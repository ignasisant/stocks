# TopStocks — container image for any container host. The live deploy is
# Cloud Run (see scripts/deploy.sh), a source deploy of this image. Serves the
# React shell on $PORT (default 8501), with Streamlit mounted read-only at
# /legacy.
#
# Secrets: bind-mount the real .streamlit/secrets.toml (what deploy/ does), or
# set STREAMLIT_SECRETS_TOML to its full contents and the entrypoint writes it
# to disk at boot. [storage] may alternatively come in as individual
# STOCKS_STORAGE_* env vars (see src/stocks/storage.py).

# Create + own /app as root FIRST: the classic (non-BuildKit) Docker builder

# serves for this repo is model.safetensors *and* an ONNX copy of the same
# weights, and from_pretrained fetches both while reading only the first — 123MB
# of image for a file nothing opens. It cannot simply be deleted afterwards: the
# next offline load fails huggingface_hub's snapshot completeness check.
# save_pretrained writes what the model actually needs and nothing else, and the
# hub cache goes with the layer that created it.
#
# HF_HUB_OFFLINE stays on so a missing directory fails loudly at load instead of
# quietly reaching for the network on a revision that has no egress.
