"""The demo book (stocks.portfolio.demo) and the two promises it makes.

An account that has not imported anything finds every ledger-derived surface
blank, and not everyone wants to hand over a real statement to find out
whether the app is worth one. The demo book is the answer to that, and it is
only safe while both of its promises hold:

* it is **recognisable as fake** — every row carries the `demo` origin the
  Fees and Custody views read, and the page it fills says so;
* it is **gone the moment anything real arrives** — the first import wipes it,
  from the Import page and from the assistant alike, so an invented cost basis
  can never end up mixed into a real one and reported as tax.

The rest of these tests keep the book worth showing: prices near the real ones
(a +900% demo teaches nothing about the app), and enough shape in it that
every tab has something to draw.
