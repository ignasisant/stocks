"""Focus-driven watchlist examples (auth.focus_suggestions).

The investor profile is answered *after* the account is seeded, so it cannot
drive the initial watchlist. What it can do is offer the areas the user said
they follow as examples they do not have yet — which is what this is: a
shortcut for typing symbols, keyed on stated interest and never on risk
tolerance, and additive so an edited watchlist keeps every row it has.
