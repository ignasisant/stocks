"""The Profile page's Preferences tab, through the real script.

The tab was rebuilt from the "Aguait Perfil Refactor" canvas: settings became
label-plus-control rows inside three cards, the currency chips lost six of
their eleven options to a popover, the tax card grew a strip of the rules the
jurisdiction actually applies, and CSV export plus account deletion moved onto
the page. AppTest runs the page exactly as Streamlit does, which is the only
way to cover a page that IS a script.
