"""The shipped example statement, and the Import page's offer of it.

A brand-new account has nothing to import, so every ledger-derived surface —
positions, P/L, risk, dividends, fees, tax — is empty until it does. The
example statement is how that account can see those surfaces working without
inventing a ledger: it is a real broker statement in the repo, parsed by the
real parser, validated and committed by the real page, and undone by the
ordinary "clear last import".

What must not break: the file parses clean (a sample that errors is worse than
no sample), it fills every one of those surfaces, and the offer only ever
appears to an account with nothing to lose.
