# TopStocks

<img src="src/stocks/web/assets/topstocks-logo.svg" alt="TopStocks logo" width="270">

**TopStocks** is a personal equity tracking toolkit: fetch market
prices, compute technical indicators, run price alerts, and browse a visual
analytics dashboard. Stocks, ETFs and traded funds, and crypto pairs are all
first-class — a fund shows its cost, basket and exposure where a company shows
fundamentals, and portfolio sector allocation looks through funds to what they
hold.

## Quickstart — first 10 minutes

```bash
uv sync                                        # 1. install (creates .venv)
#    2. create .streamlit/secrets.toml with the Google OAuth client
#       — see "Login (web app)" below
uv run stocks dashboard                        # 3. opens the app in the browser
```

Market pages (Home, Ticker, Screener, Earnings, Valuation) work signed-out
with a starter watchlist; **sign in with Google** for everything personal.
Then:

4. **Profile** page — add the tickers you follow (new accounts start with
   Apple + Microsoft as examples). Home, Ticker, Screener and Earnings work
   from the watchlist alone.
5. **Import** page — drop a Revolut account-statement CSV to fill the
   transaction ledger (every row is previewed before committing).
6. **Portfolio** page — positions, EUR P/L, risk and Spanish tax now derive
   from the ledger automatically.

Prefer the terminal? Skip the OAuth setup: copy
[`watchlist.example.yaml`](watchlist.example.yaml) to `watchlist.yaml`
(git-ignored — it holds your personal positions) and edit it, then
`uv run stocks update && uv run stocks alerts`. The full command set is
under [Usage](#usage).

## Stack

- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** — Python + dependency manager (Python 3.12)
- **yfinance** — price data (no API key needed)
- **pandas** — data wrangling
- **Streamlit + Plotly** — the dashboard / "website"
- **BYOK LLMs** (Claude / ChatGPT / Gemini SDKs, optional) — the portfolio-aware
  chat assistant; see [AI assistant](#ai-assistant--chat-with-your-portfolio)
- **pytest + ruff** — tests and linting

## Setup

```bash
uv sync            # create .venv and install everything
```

### Login (web app)

Browsing the market pages (Home, Ticker, Screener, Earnings, Valuation) is
public — anonymous visitors get a shared read-only starter watchlist under
`data/users/_guest/`. Google sign-in (Streamlit-native OIDC: `st.login` /
`st.user`) is required only for everything personal: the Portfolio, Import
and Profile pages, plus the favorite/tag/watchlist-editing actions. Each
Google account gets its own private data under `data/users/<slug>/` —
watchlist, portfolio ledger, last-import record and preferences — keyed by
the verified account email. The optional `[app].owner_email` account maps to
the repo-root `watchlist.yaml` and `data/portfolio.db` instead, so it shares
one book with the (single-user) CLI. Broker-code `aliases` stay global in
the root `watchlist.yaml`, falling back to the tracked
`watchlist.example.yaml` while that file doesn't exist.

Configure:

1. Create a Google OAuth client (Web application) at
   <https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials> with redirect URI
   `http://localhost:8501/oauth2callback`.
2. Create `.streamlit/secrets.toml` with an `[auth]` section holding
   `client_id`, `client_secret`, `redirect_uri` and a random `cookie_secret`
   (`python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"`).
3. `uv run stocks dashboard` — the portfolio pages show the sign-in screen
   until the secrets are in place; the market pages work regardless.

`secrets.toml` is git-ignored; never commit it. When deploying, add the
deployed URL + `/oauth2callback` to both the Google client and
`redirect_uri`.

### Persistent user data (deploys)

Container hosts (and most PaaS) have an **ephemeral filesystem**: `data/users/` and every imported ledger vanish on
restart or redeploy. To keep them, point the app at any S3-compatible
bucket (Cloudflare R2 free tier is plenty) via the `[storage]` section of
`secrets.toml` or the equivalent `STOCKS_STORAGE_*` env vars.

With a bucket configured, every write (watchlist edits, statement imports,
prefs) is mirrored to it immediately, and each account's files are pulled
back the first time it's touched after a boot. Object keys mirror the local
paths (`data/users/<slug>/portfolio.db`, plus the owner's repo-root
`watchlist.yaml` / `data/portfolio.db`). Unconfigured — the default for
local dev — everything stays plain files, no bucket or boto3 credentials
needed.

The bucket holds **every** account's ledgers and watchlists, so scope its
credentials tightly: use an API token limited to that one bucket with
object read/write only (on R2: *Object Read & Write* on the specific
bucket), never an account-level key. Keep the bucket private (no public
access / dev URL) and enable object versioning so a bad write can be
rolled back.

### Deploy — Oracle Cloud Always Free VM (Docker + Caddy)

The live deploy runs the repo `Dockerfile` on a free-forever Oracle ARM VM,
behind Caddy for automatic HTTPS on an `<ip>.sslip.io` hostname (no domain,
no signup). Full walkthrough — VM creation, ports, secrets, updates — in
[`deploy/README.md`](deploy/README.md); the compose file, Caddyfile and
cloud-init live beside it in [`deploy/`](deploy).

Short version, on the VM:

```bash
scp .streamlit/secrets.toml ubuntu@<VM_IP>:/opt/aguait-stocks/deploy/secrets.toml
echo "SITE_ADDRESS=<ip-with-dashes>.sslip.io" > deploy/.env
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d --build
```

Then add `https://<ip-with-dashes>.sslip.io/oauth2callback` to the Google
OAuth client and set the same URL as `[auth] redirect_uri` in `secrets.toml`.
The image also runs unchanged on any other container host; there,
`STREAMLIT_SECRETS_TOML` (full `secrets.toml` contents) is written to disk by
`scripts/docker-entrypoint.sh` at boot instead of bind-mounting the file.

Local check of the same image:

```bash
docker build -t topstocks .
docker run --rm -p 8501:8501 \
  -e STREAMLIT_SECRETS_TOML="$(cat .streamlit/secrets.toml)" topstocks
```

Edit the tickers you follow in `watchlist.yaml` (copy
[`watchlist.example.yaml`](watchlist.example.yaml) to create it — the real
file is git-ignored because it carries your positions).

## AI assistant — chat with your portfolio

A slide-in assistant panel is reachable from every page (the ✨ launcher pinned
top-right, signed-in users only). It's not a generic chatbot bolted on: **every
message carries a live snapshot of your real book and your current view**, so
you can ask "am I too concentrated in tech?", "which position is dragging me
today?", or "does NVDA still fit my thesis at this weight?" and get an answer
grounded in *your* numbers, not generic advice.

What the model sees on each turn (assembled in
[`chat_core.py`](src/stocks/web/chat_core.py) `_system_prompt`):

- **Your live holdings** — the same frame the Portfolio page shows: shares,
  EUR value, cost, unrealised P/L (% and EUR), portfolio weight and today's
  move per name, plus the total book value and P/L. Sourced from the imported
  FIFO ledger valued at live prices (cached per account); falls back to the
  watchlist's `shares`/`cost` when no ledger exists yet.
- **Your watchlist** — tickers you follow but don't hold, so it can reason
  about candidates too.
- **Your current view** — which page you're on and the ticker in focus, so a
  question like "is this one expensive?" resolves to what's on screen.
- **A fixed persona** — a concise investing assistant briefed that you're an
  aggressive long-term (5y+) investor; it gives analysis and trade-offs, flags
  what needs your own judgement, and does **not** pose as a licensed advisor.

Only the signed-in account's own data is read (`auth.db_path` /
`auth.watchlist_path`); nothing crosses between users.

### Daily action card (dashboard)

The dashboard opens with **Daily action** — two or three things to *decide or
check today*, each with the trigger that raised it. Not a summary of the day:
the figures are already on the tiles below it.

The triggers are computed, never invented
([`chat/signals.py`](src/stocks/chat/signals.py)); the model only chooses which
matter most and phrases them:

| Trigger | Raised when |
| --- | --- |
| `alert_hit` / `alert_near` | a price alert **you** set on a watchlist entry fired, or sits within 3% of firing — the closest thing to a stated exit/entry rule |
| `harvest` | an open loss ≥150 against gains **already realised this tax year**, with the jurisdiction's repurchase window (ES two months, US/CA 30 days, IE 28) attached |
| `earnings` | a held name reports inside 5 days — a date to decide before |
| `drawdown` | a position 25%+ under its cost: re-read the thesis, not a sell call |
| `concentration` | one name past 30% of the book |
| `low_52w` | a watchlist name (not held) within 3% of its 52-week low |

- **One briefing a day.** It turns over at 09:00 in your own timezone
  ([`chat/daily.py`](src/stocks/chat/daily.py) `action_day`); before that the
  previous day's card stands, stamped with its date. The card is stored per
  account (`daily_action.json`, mirrored to the bucket like every other user
  file), so reruns, reloads and container restarts re-read it instead of
  spending another model call.
- **Free-tier friendly.** Generation goes through the same BYOK → free chain as
  the chat and spends one unit of the account's daily allowance, at most once a
  day. It costs no fetch of its own — every input is a frame the dashboard had
  already loaded.
- **Never a blank card.** No key, allowance spent, provider down — the same
  triggers are rendered without a model, so what degrades is the ordering and
  the phrasing, not the substance. Nothing triggered says exactly that.
- **Analysis, not directives.** The prompt forbids invented triggers and
  buy/sell/hold calls; a harvest line states the tax arithmetic and its
  repurchase rule, it does not tell you to sell.

### Bring your own key (multi-provider)

The assistant is **BYOK** — you supply your own API key and pay your own
provider bill; the app ships no keys and makes no calls on its own account
(unless the deploy opts into the free chain below). Three BYOK providers ship
in the registry ([`llm.py`](src/stocks/web/llm.py)), each with a model picker:

| Provider | Models | Get a key |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude** (default) | Opus 4.8, Sonnet 5, Haiku 4.5 | [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys) |
| **ChatGPT** | GPT-5, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini | [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) |
| **Gemini** | Flash / Pro (rolling `-latest`) | [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) |

Each provider's SDK is imported lazily, so a provider only appears when its
package is installed — a missing optional dependency disables that one entry
instead of breaking the panel. Answers **stream** token-by-token; SDK errors
are classified into friendly messages (invalid key / no credits / API error)
in your language.

### Free assistant, no user key (`[free_llm]`)

Optionally, the deploy can offer a keyless **TopStocks AI** provider: a chain of
free-tier backends billed to *operator* keys in `secrets.toml`. Users get chat
with zero setup; when a backend answers with a rate-limit (or any error before
its first token), the chain hops to the next one, and only errors out once
every configured backend is exhausted.

```toml
[free_llm]
# Configure any subset; fallback order is groq -> cerebras -> openrouter.
groq = "gsk_..."          # console.groq.com/keys
cerebras = "csk-..."      # cloud.cerebras.ai
openrouter = "sk-or-..."  # openrouter.ai/settings/keys (:free models)
# Optional per-backend model override (a retired free model is a config fix):
# groq_model = "llama-3.3-70b-versatile"
# Per-account daily message allowance (default 30):
# daily_cap = 30
# Who may spend the chain: trial (default) | open | established | allowlist
# eligibility = "trial"
# What a not-yet-established account gets per day (default 5):
# trial_cap = 5
# How long "not yet established" lasts (default 24):
# min_account_hours = 24
# eligibility = "allowlist" only:
# allowed_emails = "you@example.com, someone@else.com"
```

When configured, TopStocks AI is listed first and becomes the default for
accounts that never picked a provider; the BYOK entries stay available in the
same selector. Each account gets a **daily message cap** (`daily_cap`, counted
in its prefs) so one user can't drain the shared quota, and the process keeps a
shared **global** daily pot (`global_daily_cap`, default 400) on top of it.

Because a Google sign-in is free to obtain in bulk, `eligibility` decides who
gets near the operator's keys. The default, **`trial`**, lets a brand-new
account use the assistant in the session it signed up in, on the smaller
`trial_cap` allowance, and moves it to the full `daily_cap` once it is
`min_account_hours` old — so farming throwaway accounts buys a handful of
messages each instead of the pot everyone else depends on. `open` hands out the
full cap from the first minute; `established` is the hard wall (no free chain at
all until the account is a day old); `allowlist` serves only `allowed_emails`.
BYOK is untouched by all four — a user spending their own key needs no
permission.

Mind the fine print:
free tiers route your prompts — including the portfolio snapshot — through the
chosen vendors; check each vendor's data policy, or leave `[free_llm]` unset
to stay strictly BYOK.

### Key storage & privacy

- Your key stays in session by default. Tick **Remember** and it's encrypted
  (Fernet) and persisted for **90 days**. The window **slides**: every turn
  your key actually serves pushes it out again, so an account you keep using
  never has to re-enter it. An **absolute cap of 180 days** from the moment
  you entered the key is never refreshed — after that you type it once more.
  Rotating the server's `[chat].enc_key` invalidates every stored key on the
  spot.
- Expiry **deletes** the stored ciphertext (`<pid>_key_enc` and its
  timestamps) the next time the account is read, in prefs and in the bucket
  mirror — an abandoned account doesn't sit on a decryptable provider key.
  The daily digest only reads a key, never slides it, so it can't keep one
  alive on its own.
- The encryption is at rest, not zero-knowledge: `[chat].enc_key` lives on the
  server (and in the Actions secrets the digest/Telegram jobs use), so a
  bucket-only leak yields useless ciphertext, while server compromise does
  not. Blast radius is your provider bill — revoke the key at the provider.
- Key storage is **account-scoped** (prefs `<pid>_key_enc`), so multiple users
  never share a key. **Forget** wipes it from session and prefs immediately.
- **Chat history persists per account** (one thread per watchlist, mirrored to
  disk / your S3 bucket) so it survives reloads, new sessions, and ephemeral
  redeploys — see [Persistent user data](#persistent-user-data-deploys).
- Enabling encrypted "Remember" needs `[chat].enc_key` in `secrets.toml`
  (`python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"`).
  Without it the assistant still works — keys just aren't remembered across
  sessions.

### Upload your Revolut transactions (dashboard)

The ledger is the single source of truth for your book. The fastest way to fill
it: launch the dashboard (`uv run stocks dashboard`), open the **📥 Import** page,
and drop a **Revolut** account-statement CSV (Revolut → Stocks → statement, CSV).
Every parsed row is previewed before anything is written; press **Commit** to load
it. Re-importing an overlapping export duplicates rows, so tick *Wipe ledger first*
for a clean re-import.

From there the **📊 Portfolio** page derives everything from those transactions
(FIFO): open positions & EUR P/L, allocation & risk (EUR-weighted), realized
gains + IRPF savings-base tax, and dividends.

Notes on the Revolut parser (`src/stocks/portfolio/revolut.py`): buy/sell/dividend
rows import; cash top-ups/withdrawals, fees and **stock splits** are skipped (the
statement gives the resulting share count, not the split ratio — add splits by hand
with `stocks tx add … split --qty <ratio>`). Dividends import as gross with 0
withholding, since Revolut's CSV doesn't break out withholding tax — edit the fee
on those rows if you want the double-tax credit computed.

## Fundamental KPIs & data sources

Every KPI is tagged with a reliability level and a verification source
(see `KPI_SOURCES` in `src/stocks/analysis/fundamentals.py`):

- **fact** — verifiable in a primary source (SEC EDGAR 10-K/10-Q)
- **consensus** — analyst/market aggregate (forward P/E, PEG)
- **derived** — computed here from statements (ROIC, FCF yield, CAGRs)

Loading vs verification are separate concerns:

| Purpose | Source | Key |
|---|---|---|
| Load prices + fundamentals | yfinance | none |
| Verify facts (primary, US filers) | SEC EDGAR companyfacts API | none (`EDGAR_USER_AGENT` in `.env`) |
| Spot FX (tax basis, any base ccy) | frankfurter.dev (ECB rates) | none |
| Manual cross-check: 10y ratios | stockanalysis.com | — |
| Manual cross-check: 15-20y trends | macrotrends.net | — |
| Manual cross-check: consensus/comps | Koyfin / TIKR | — |

Known caveats baked into the code: yfinance PEG is unreliable (flagged in
dashboard + CLI output); missing data renders as `n/a`, never invented.

KPI set: P/E (TTM/fwd), P/B, EV/EBITDA, EV/Sales, ROE, ROIC, margins
(gross/op/net), FCF + FCF yield, net debt/EBITDA, cash conversion (FCF/NI),
5y CAGRs (revenue, net income, FCF) and diluted-share dilution (SBC proxy).

## Forward valuation (DCF + reverse-DCF)

`stocks value` (💰 dashboard page) turns fundamentals into a forward fair value
without a spreadsheet — the piece a tool like TIKR charges for:

- **DCF** projects free cash flow over an explicit horizon and discounts it,
  with a Gordon-growth terminal (`--terminal-growth`) or a relative
  `--exit-multiple`. Every result reports `terminal %` — the share of value
  from the terminal — as a confidence gauge (high = shaky).
- **Bull / base / bear** from a base growth `±spread`, plus a probability-weighted
  (25/50/25) fair value and margin of safety.
- **Reverse-DCF** (`implied_growth`) inverts the model: the constant FCF growth
  the *current price* already assumes. Compare it to your base to judge whether
  the market's baked-in expectation is beatable — the useful question for a
  growth-tilted book.
- **Consensus prefill** (`stocks.data.estimates`): analyst price targets, rating
  split, and next-FY EPS/revenue growth seed the base case. All **consensus**
  level — cross-check before acting; missing coverage degrades to `n/a`.

The math (`stocks.analysis.valuation`) is pure and unit-tested offline; only
`gather` touches the network. Inputs (growth, discount, terminal, horizon) are
yours to own — the output is **derived**, only as good as the assumptions.

## Portfolio analytics, screener & alerts

Decision-support layer over the watchlist — dashboard pages (Streamlit
`st.navigation` multipage, under `web/app_pages/`) and matching CLI commands:

- **Portfolio analytics** (`stocks portfolio`, 📊 page): allocation by
  sector / geography / currency, concentration (top-5 weight, effective number
  of names via 1/HHI), annualised return & volatility, max drawdown, beta vs
  SPY / QQQ / EEM, and a return-correlation heatmap. Add `shares:` (and optional
  `cost:`) in `watchlist.yaml` for market-value weighting and unrealised P/L;
  without them the book is equal-weighted so the risk view still works.
- **Screener** (`stocks screen`, 🔎 page): rank and filter the whole watchlist
  by any KPI — cheap P/E, high ROIC, high FCF yield, low leverage. Repeatable
  `--min KEY=VAL` / `--max KEY=VAL` (percent metrics are fractions: `0.15` = 15%).
- **Earnings calendar** (`stocks earnings`, 📅 page): next report date per name,
  sorted soonest-first, windowed by `--days`.
- **Upgraded alerts + delivery** (`stocks alerts`): beyond `above`/`below`,
  rules for `pct_move`, `drawdown`, `rsi_below`/`rsi_above`, `sma_cross`, and
  `high_52w`/`low_52w`. `--deliver` pushes hits (and, with `--earnings-days N`,
  earnings reminders) to any channel configured in `.env` — Telegram and/or
  email over SMTP; unconfigured channels are skipped, so it degrades to console.

Pure logic (screening, portfolio math, alert evaluation, earnings-date
selection) is unit-tested offline; only the fetchers touch the network.

## Portfolio, FIFO & tax

Positions and tax derive from one source of truth: a transaction ledger in
SQLite (`data/portfolio.db`, gitignored — it's your private book). Record
`buy | sell | dividend | fee | split` events; everything else is computed.

**Reporting currency.** Profile → *Reporting currency* (EUR, USD, GBP, CHF,
SEK, NOK, DKK, PLN, CZK, CAD, AUD) is
not a display setting: the ledger is replayed *in* it, every leg at the rate for
its own trade date, so positions, P/L, the TWR series, dividends and fees are
computed in it rather than converted at the end (`positions.build(base=…)`,
`analysis.portfolio.*(base=…)`, and the cached web loaders key on it). The CLI
takes `-c/--currency` on the money commands. The **Realized & tax** tab is the
exception — it follows the tax residence, which is a legal fact, not a taste.

Tax is per **jurisdiction** (`src/stocks/portfolio/tax/`). Twelve ship today:
Spain (IRPF), the United States (federal capital gains), the United Kingdom
(CGT), Germany (Abgeltungsteuer), France (PFU), Italy (imposta sostitutiva),
Ireland (CGT + fund exit tax), Portugal (IRS), Canada (CRA), Australia (ATO)
the United Arab Emirates and Switzerland — the last two tax a private
portfolio at 0%, and are modelled precisely so the tab can say so with your own
numbers instead of leaving those residents reading Spanish brackets. A
jurisdiction whose answer is "nothing" still owns the boundary that would
change it: the UAE's 9% corporate tax on a licensed entity, Switzerland's KS 36
professional-dealer test. A jurisdiction also owns two things beyond its rates:

- the **share-matching rule** the replay uses (`positions.build(matching=…)`) —
  `fifo` (ES, US, DE, IE, PT, AU, AE, CH), `lifo` (IT), `average` for a moving
  weighted-average cost base (FR's prix moyen pondéré, CA's ACB), or `s104` for
  the UK's same-day → 30-day → pool identification. The same trades give
  different gains under each, which is why this is not a display choice;
- the **tax-year boundary** — 6 April in the UK, 1 July in Australia, 1 January
  elsewhere — so the year selector, the period filter and the year label
  ("2025", "2025/26", "2025-26") follow the country rather than the calendar.

Pick yours on the Profile page — *Tax residence*, defaulting to your browser's
region and falling back to Spain — or pass
`-j ES|US|UK|DE|FR|IT|IE|PT|CA|AU|AE|CH` to `stocks tax`. That fallback is not
silent: when the browser names a country the app does not model, the tab says
the gains are yours but the rules on top of them are borrowed
(`tax_ui.resolve()` returns *how* the jurisdiction was arrived at, and only
`UNMODELLED` warns — a locale with no region at all does not). The choice sets the rules, the reporting currency and the
wording: the ledger is replayed **at** that currency (EUR at the ECB rate of
each transaction date for Spain, USD at that date's rate for the US, CAD for
Canada), because a cost basis is a per-transaction conversion and not something
you can convert once at the end. The ECB publishes no dirham series, so AED
resolves through its fixed 3.6725 peg to the dollar (`fx.PEGS`) rather than a
fetch. Jurisdictions that read your other income or a
sub-national rate ask for it on the Profile page, and only there — an ES
account never sees a bracket input. Adding a country means one module plus its
`portfolio.<code>_*` catalog keys — no page edits.

The marketing landing argues one country's case per page, so it ships four
URLs: `/` (English, US rules), `/es/` (Spanish, Spain), `/en-es/` (English,
Spain) and `/es-us/` (Spanish, US). hreflang pairs translations only — the two
Spain-tax pages with each other, the two US-tax ones with each other — and the
in-page toggles switch one axis at a time.

### Spain (IRPF)

- **FIFO** (art. 37 LIRPF): sales match oldest lots first. Acquisition cost
  includes buy commissions; proceeds are net of sell commissions.
- **EUR at transaction date**: every leg converts to EUR at the ECB rate for
  its date (frankfurter.dev, cached in `data/fx_history.json`; weekends resolve
  to the prior business day). This is the Hacienda basis, not spot. The same
  machinery values a book in any reporting currency — see below.
- **IRPF savings base**: progressive brackets (19/21/23/27/28%); losses net
  against gains; net loss carries forward 4 years.
- **Regla de los 2 meses** (art. 33.5.f): a loss is auto-deferred when
  homogeneous shares are repurchased within 2 months of the sale.
- **Dividends**: foreign withholding split into the Spain-creditable part
  (treaty cap ~15%) and the reclaimable excess (e.g. French over-withholding).
- **Modelo 720 flag**: warns when foreign holdings clear the 50.000 EUR line.

### United States (IRS, federal)

- **Short vs long term**: long-term needs *more* than a year of holding (the
  anniversary itself is still short). Ordinary rates on the net short-term
  gain, stacked on the other taxable income you set in Profile; 0/15/20% on the
  net long-term gain; optional 3.8% NIIT above the MAGI threshold.
- **Wash sale** (IRC 1091): a loss is disallowed when the same security is
  bought back within 30 days either side, and is restored — with its original
  short/long character — as the replacement shares are sold.
- **Loss limits** (IRC 1211/1212): net capital losses deduct $3,000 against
  ordinary income ($1,500 filing separately); the rest carries forward
  indefinitely.
- **FBAR / Form 8938 flags**: thresholds crossed by holdings abroad
  ($10,000 aggregate; $50k/$75k single, $100k/$150k joint). Federal only — no
  state tax, no lot elections, no Section 1256.

### United Kingdom (CGT)

- **Share identification** (TCGA 1992 s.105/106A), in the replay rather than
  the tax module: same-day acquisitions first, then anything bought in the 30
  days *after* a disposal (the bed-and-breakfast rule — sell and buy back next
  week and no loss is banked), then the Section 104 pool at average cost. The
  Realized table names the rule each parcel used, because a pooled "cost" is
  not the lot you thought you sold.
- **Tax year 6 April – 5 April**: a February disposal belongs to the year that
  opened the previous April, and the selector reads "2025/26".
- **Annual Exempt Amount** £3,000 (£6,000 in 2023/24, £12,300 before). Losses
  come off *before* it, so a loss-making year can waste the allowance — the tab
  says how much went to waste.
- **Rates**: 18% inside the remaining basic-rate band, 24% above (from 30
  October 2024; 2024/25 straddled the change and is flagged as priced
  post-Budget). Losses carry forward indefinitely once claimed.
- **£50,000 proceeds test**: flagged as a note when disposals pass it, since a
  return is due then even with no gain.

### Germany (Abgeltungsteuer)

- **Flat rate**: 25% plus the 5.5% solidarity surcharge *on the tax*
  (26.375%), plus church tax at 8% or 9% of the tax where it applies (~27.99%).
- **Two loss circles** (§20(6) EStG): losses on shares offset only gains on
  shares; fund and other losses offset capital income generally, share gains
  included. Both carry forward indefinitely, and separately.
- **Teilfreistellung**: 30% of an equity fund's result is exempt — losses as
  well as gains. Applied to the holdings classified as funds from the learned
  Yahoo `quoteType` cache; an unclassified book computes without it and says so.
- **Sparer-Pauschbetrag**: €1,000, €2,000 on a joint return.
- **Anlage KAP / AWV flags**: a foreign broker withholds no Abgeltungsteuer, so
  the income has to be declared; €5m in foreign securities adds Bundesbank
  statistical reporting. No Vorabpauschale and no Günstigerprüfung — both are
  stated in the tab rather than silently skipped.

### France (PFU)

- **Prix moyen pondéré** (CGI art. 150-0 D, 3): identical securities are one
  holding at one weighted-average cost, recomputed on every purchase — so no
  parcel carries an individual purchase price, and the Realized table says
  "Average cost" rather than implying a lot.
- **Flat 30%**, shown as its two halves because they are assessed separately:
  12.8% income tax and 17.2% prélèvements sociaux (CSG/CRDS/solidarité).
- **No allowance**; losses carry forward 10 years against gains of the same
  nature only.
- **Formulaire 3916 flag**: a foreign account is declarable whatever it holds,
  so this one has no threshold to cross. No barème option, no CEHR, no PEA —
  all stated in the tab.

### Italy (imposta sostitutiva)

- **LIFO** (art. 67 c. 1-bis TUIR): the shares sold are the most recently
  bought ones, which in a rising market books a *smaller* gain than FIFO on
  identical trades.
- **Flat 26%** on the year's saldo; losses carry forward four years and then
  expire.
- **Quadro RW / IVAFE flag**: securities abroad go in RW at any value (the
  €15,000 exemption is for bank accounts), and IVAFE takes 0.2% of that value
  a year on top of the tax on gains.
- The figures are the *regime dichiarativo* view; in regime amministrato the
  broker withholds and nets your losses, which the tab says.

### Ireland (CGT + fund exit tax)

- **33% CGT** after the **€1,270 personal exemption** — which cannot be carried
  forward or transferred, so the tab reports how much of it a loss-making year
  wasted.
- **Four-week rule** (s.581 TCA 1997): a loss on shares reacquired in the four
  weeks *after* the disposal is restricted until those shares are themselves
  sold. Forward-only, unlike Spain's two months or the US 30 days either side.
- **Funds are another regime**: Irish/EU-domiciled UCITS pay **41% exit tax**,
  outside the exemption, and a loss on them relieves nothing at all. Applied to
  the holdings classified as funds; the eight-year deemed disposal and the
  domicile test are not modelled and the tab says so.
- **15 December**: CGT on disposals from 1 January to 30 November is payable in
  the same year — a period note, since it is the rule people miss.

### Portugal (IRS)

- **Flat 28%** on the year's saldo between mais-valias and menos-valias, FIFO
  matching, no allowance.
- **Mandatory aggregation** of gains on securities held **under 365 days** once
  your taxable income reaches the top IRS bracket (€83,696 for 2025): that part
  is englobado at the marginal rate instead. Below the line it stays at 28%,
  and the tab says where the line is.
- **Losses** carry forward five years — but only if you opt for englobamento in
  the year of the loss, which the tab states rather than assuming.
- **Anexo J flag**: gains at a foreign broker are declarable operation by
  operation, at any amount. No solidarity surcharge, no NHR regime.

### Canada (CRA)

- **Adjusted cost base** (ITA s.47): one average per security, so a Canadian
  basis is never a specific lot's price.
- **50% inclusion rate** — half the net gain is taxable income (the 2024
  two-thirds proposal was cancelled in March 2025) — taxed at the federal
  brackets stacked on your other income, plus a flat **provincial rate** you
  set in Profile. Provincial tax is roughly half the bill, so a federal-only
  estimate says so instead of pretending to be the answer.
- **Superficial loss** (s.40(2)(g)(i)): denied when the same security is bought
  within 30 days either side, and restored as the replacement shares are sold
  (the ACB bump, arrived at the same way the US wash sale is).
- **T1135 flag** at CAD 100,000 — measured on *cost* in the real rule, on
  market value here, and a foreign share in a Canadian account still counts.

### Australia (ATO)

- **Income year 1 July – 30 June**: a March disposal belongs to the year that
  opened the previous July, and the selector reads "2025-26".
- **50% CGT discount** past 12 months of holding — and the 12 months excludes
  both the acquisition and the disposal day, so selling on the anniversary
  loses all of it.
- **Order of operations**: capital losses come off the *gross* gains before the
  discount, and are applied to the non-discounted gains first, which is the
  taxpayer's choice and always the better one.
- **Marginal rates** plus the 2% Medicare levy; losses carry forward
  indefinitely against capital gains only. No parcel selection (FIFO), no levy
  surcharge, nothing about super.

- **Custody per broker**: each row's import note says where the shares are, so
  the Positions table names the broker behind every holding (a split holding as
  "Revolut 67% · ClickTrade 33%"), the Ticker header shows each custodian's
  brand mark next to the "in portfolio" badge, and the allocation card adds a
  broker donut whenever the book spans more than one. Tax stays FIFO across
  brokers.

Planning aid, not tax advice. All tax and matching logic is pure and
unit-tested (`tests/test_ledger.py`, `tests/test_positions_s104.py`,
`tests/test_positions_average.py`, then `test_tax_es | us | uk | de | fr | it |
ie | pt | ca | au.py`, plus `tests/test_portfolio_tax_tab.py` rendering the tab
once per jurisdiction); FX is injectable so tests run offline.

### Agent skills

`.claude/skills/` is versioned and shared with everyone who clones the repo —
procedures a coding agent should follow that the code itself cannot express
(currently: keeping the in-app tutorial in step with shipped features). See
[.claude/skills/README.md](.claude/skills/README.md) for the convention and
how to add one. Only `settings.local.json` and the Streamlit symlink in there
are per-machine and gitignored.

## The landing page and the app share one port

`stocks dashboard` serves `web/server.py`, an `st.App` that answers a few paths
itself and hands everything else to the Streamlit app:

| Path | Served by |
|------|-----------|
| `/` | the landing page — **unless** the request carries a query parameter or the `ts_app` cookie, in which case the app |
| `/es/` | the landing page in Spanish |
| `/lp/*` | the landing's assets (brand mark, `og.png` share card) |
| `/robots.txt`, `/sitemap.xml` | generated for whichever host answered |
| everything else | the Streamlit app, stamped `X-Robots-Tag: noindex` |

The landing is a plain HTML response: the copy is in the document, so it is
crawlable and paints without booting a websocket, and it can carry a `<title>`,
a description, hreflang pairs and an Open Graph card — none of which a Streamlit
page can set. `/` is shared because Streamlit always serves its default page at
the root and `st.Page` ignores `url_path` there; a first visit (no parameter, no
cookie) is the landing, every CTA click arrives with a parameter, and the cookie
is set on every app response so returning visitors skip the pitch. Crawlers send
no cookies, so they always see the landing.

**Set `[app] public_url` in secrets (or `APP_PUBLIC_URL`) on any real deploy** —
not only behind a custom domain. Cloud Run answers on more than one hostname by
default, and unset, each one serves a full copy of the site that canonicalizes
to *itself*: duplicate content, split link equity, and Google choosing which
copy ranks. Set, it is the base for every canonical, hreflang, Open Graph and
sitemap URL, and every other hostname 301s to it (GET/HEAD only, and never
`/_stcore/` — moving a live websocket would break the session a visitor is
already in). Nothing else needs configuring: no `baseUrlPath`, and the OIDC
redirect URI is unchanged.

Unknown paths return a real **404**. Streamlit's static mount answers anything
it does not recognise with the app shell and a 200, which turns every typo and
stale link into a soft 404. The gate in `server.py` knows the whole served
surface — the marketing pages, Streamlit's own endpoints, and the app's pages
derived from `app_pages/` so a new page needs no edit — and 404s the rest.

## Observability — production logs

The app logs one JSON object per event to stdout. Cloud Run forwards stdout to
Cloud Logging, which indexes those keys as queryable fields, so production
questions are queries rather than grep:

```json
{"severity":"ERROR","message":"page.render","event":"page.render","ok":false,
 "duration_ms":812,"page":"Cartera","user":"a_b_c_1f2e3d4c","error_type":"KeyError"}
```

Emit side — `stocks.obs`, no dependencies, shared by the dashboard, the CLI and
the scheduled jobs:

```python
from stocks import obs

obs.event("chat.answered", provider="free", chars=120)   # a fact
with obs.timed("page.render", page=title) as extra:      # + duration_ms, ok
    extra["rows"] = len(df)
with obs.swallow("logo.mirror", ticker=t):               # degrade, but leave a trace
    mirror(t)
```

`stocks.web.telemetry.bind_run()` runs once per Streamlit script run and binds
`session`, `user` and `page` onto every record the run emits — from any module
— so one visit reads as one timeline. `user` is the account slug (the same key
its data directory uses), never the raw address; `STOCKS_LOG_USER=0` drops it.
Verbosity is `STOCKS_LOG_LEVEL` (default `INFO`), so a revision can be turned
up to `DEBUG` without a code change. Locally the same calls print a compact
human line instead of JSON.

What is instrumented today: page renders and page crashes, sign-in, the free
LLM chain (which backend answered, which failed and why), Telegram chat
replies, and Yahoo rate limiting.

Query side — `stocks logs`, which shells out to `gcloud` (whoever is logged in
with `gcloud auth login` and can read the project's logs can run it):

```bash
uv run stocks logs tail --since 30m              # recent app output, oldest first
uv run stocks logs errors --since 24h            # severity>=ERROR, with tracebacks
uv run stocks logs tail --event llm.free.backend_failed --since 7d
uv run stocks logs tail --user a_b_c_1f2e3d4c --since 2h   # one account's timeline
uv run stocks logs tail --http --since 15m       # the HTTP access log instead
uv run stocks logs stats --since 24h             # count/errors/p50/p95 per event
uv run stocks logs stats --since 24h --by page   # ...or per page, per user, ...
uv run stocks logs export --since 7d --level ERROR   # JSONL snapshot in data/logs/
```

Cloud Logging keeps 30 days; `export` writes a JSONL snapshot to `data/logs/`
(git-ignored) for anything worth keeping longer, and every command takes
`--file <snapshot>` to read it back with no network. Project and service
default to the deploy in `stocks.logs_query`; `STOCKS_GCP_PROJECT` /
`STOCKS_GCP_SERVICE` (or `--project` / `--service`) point them elsewhere.

Errors also reach **Cloud Error Reporting** — records at `ERROR` carry the
inline traceback and the `ReportedErrorEvent` type it groups on — so repeated
crashes collapse into one issue with a count instead of scrolling past.

### Product usage

`stocks logs usage` (default: last 7 days) rolls the same structured events up
into users / page runs / chat turns / feedback per day, plus per-page totals —
product analytics with no tracker: everything comes from the logs the app
already writes. Sign-ins show up event-by-event too: the first run of a
session emits `auth.login`, or `auth.signup` when that run created the
account.

### Accounts

Logs are kept 30 days, so they cannot answer *how many accounts exist* — an
account that signed up once and never came back has aged out of them. Every
account's `prefs.json` carries the two dates that survive (`first_seen`,
`last_seen`, stamped by `auth.mark_login` at most once a day), and the roster
reads them straight from the bucket:

```bash
uv run stocks users                  # signup + last-seen date per account
uv run stocks users --days 7         # ...with new/active tallies over 7 days
uv run stocks users --json           # rows for a script
```

Accounts that predate this bookkeeping get `first_seen` backfilled on their
next sign-in and are marked `~` — dated, but not exact.

### User feedback

Every page carries a "Send feedback" button at the bottom of the sidebar,
opening a modal with the comment form (guests included, burst-limited).
Submissions land as JSON under `data/feedback/` (mirrored to the bucket)
*and* as a `feedback` log event.
Read them with `stocks feedback`, or in the timeline via
`stocks logs tail --event feedback`.

### Alerting & uptime

`/healthz` answers on the shared port with no dependencies — the target for an
uptime check. One-time setup of the whole alerting surface (email channel,
uptime check, "healthz down" and "ERROR logs" policies, definitions in
`infra/monitoring/`):

```bash
./scripts/setup_monitoring.sh you@example.com
```

## Backups & restore

The R2 bucket behind `stocks.storage` is a **mirror, not a backup** — a corrupt
write replaces the only copy immediately. `.github/workflows/backup.yml`
snapshots every live object daily under `backups/<stamp>/…` (server-side
copies, last 30 kept). The same secrets the notify workflow uses are enough.

```bash
uv run stocks backup run              # snapshot now (and prune to --keep)
uv run stocks backup list             # what exists
uv run stocks backup restore <stamp>  # copy a snapshot back over the live keys
uv run stocks backup restore <stamp> --only data/users/<slug>/   # one account
```

Restore never deletes: keys the snapshot lacks are left alone. After a restore,
**restart/redeploy the app** — a running container treats its local files as
authoritative and would re-push them over what you just restored. Verify with
`stocks backup list` + a spot-check (`stocks positions` for the owner book, or
the account's Profile page) before deleting anything.

## Schema migrations

`portfolio.db` is versioned via SQLite's `PRAGMA user_version`
(`stocks/portfolio/ledger.py`). To change the schema: update `SCHEMA`, bump
`SCHEMA_VERSION`, add the upgrade SQL to `MIGRATIONS`. Every `connect()` —
web, CLI, cron — applies pending steps in order, one transaction per step, so
any process upgrades any db it touches and a failed step rolls back cleanly.
Backups (above) keep the pre-migration copies.

## Deploying (staging → prod)

Prod runs on Cloud Run (`topstocks`, europe-west1); staging is a second,
scale-to-zero service (`topstocks-staging`, free when idle). `scripts/deploy.sh`
wraps the source deploy:

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh                 # staging — try the change on a real URL
./scripts/deploy.sh prod            # gated: clean tree + on origin/main + green CI
./scripts/deploy.sh prod --allow-unmerged    # ship a branch tip anyway
./scripts/deploy.sh prod --min-instances 0   # accept cold starts, save money
./scripts/rollback.sh prod          # undo: traffic back to the previous revision
```

Every deploy is a canary. The new revision goes up with **0% traffic** under
the `candidate` tag and is smoke-tested on its own URL — `/livez`, then
`/status` checked against the revision name it should be reporting — before
any traffic moves. A revision that fails to boot is never promoted and nobody
sees it. `--no-canary` restores the old straight-to-traffic behaviour.

The prod gate reads `git status --untracked-files=all`, not `git diff`: the
deploy uploads the working tree, so a file that was never `git add`-ed ships
exactly like a modified one. Commit it or `.gitignore` it.

It also refuses a commit that is not on `origin/main`. A green branch tip
otherwise passes every check, and prod ends up serving work that main's history
does not contain — until the next deploy, cut from main and just as green,
quietly takes it away again. Every revision is stamped with its commit (a
`commit` label, and `STOCKS_COMMIT` that `/status` reports), so when the commit
being deployed does not contain the one prod is serving, the gate lists exactly
which commits would disappear and asks for the service name, not a `y`.
`--allow-unmerged` skips the ancestry refusal; it does not skip that list.

Prod keeps one instance warm by default (`--min-instances 1`) so first paint
never eats a container boot. `/status` on either service reports the serving
revision, the commit it was built from, uptime and whether persistence is
configured. Cost backstops: a GCP
budget alert (`./scripts/setup_budget.sh <billing-account>`), an Artifact
Registry cleanup policy so deploy images stop accumulating
(`./scripts/setup_registry_cleanup.sh --dry-run` first — it keeps the 5 newest
and deletes untagged images older than 14 days), and a global daily cap on the
free LLM chain (`FREE_LLM_GLOBAL_DAILY_CAP`, default 400, on top of the
per-account cap). Incidents: see `docs/RUNBOOK.md` — triage commands,
rollback, restore, secrets rotation.

## CI & security

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — ruff + the full test suite on every push/PR;
  `pip-audit` over `uv.lock` on main and weekly. Deploy only from a green main.
- `.github/dependabot.yml` — weekly grouped dependency bumps, gated by CI.
- `web/server.py` sends baseline security headers on every response (nosniff,
  `frame-ancestors 'self'`, Referrer-Policy, HSTS on TLS); the chat panel is
  burst-limited per account (`web/ratelimit.py`) on top of the free chain's
  daily cap.
- `/legal/privacy` and `/legal/terms` (EN/ES, linked from the landing footer)
  state the data handling and the "not investment advice" disclaimer; account
  deletion is self-serve on the Profile page and erases disk + bucket copies.

## Telegram notifications & chat

Every account can self-serve two notification streams — and a full two-way
chat with the app's AI assistant — delivered by one shared Telegram bot
(create it with @BotFather):

- **Daily digest** (weekday evenings, after the US close): portfolio value,
  day/week change, top movers, earnings in the next 7 days, and an optional
  1-2 sentence LLM highlight — written with the user's own saved (BYOK) chat
  key when present, falling back to the `[free_llm]` chain, else omitted. The
  last few delivered highlights are kept in `alerts_state.json` and shown to
  the model so it doesn't rewrite yesterday's sentence; a reply that echoes
  one anyway is dropped rather than re-rolled.
- **Price alerts** (hourly on market days): the per-holding rules from the
  watchlist (`above`/`below`/`pct_move`/`drawdown`/RSI/SMA/52w), editable in
  the app from the ticker page's *Alerts* popover. A rule messages once when
  it fires, then stays quiet until it clears or 24h pass
  (`data/.../alerts_state.json`). When something is actually going out, one
  LLM call adds a 1-2 sentence note on what the fired rules have in common —
  same provider resolution as the digest, and never advice to buy or sell.

Both lines are optional by construction: no key, an empty free pot, an error
or a 45 s timeout just ships the computed message. Free-chain calls made by
these crons are charged to the process-wide daily pot
(`FREE_LLM_GLOBAL_DAILY_CAP`), never to the account's own counter — the jobs
never write `prefs.json`, and the shared keys are the operator's cost to bound.
BYOK calls are the user's own billing and are not charged at all.

- **Assistant chat**: message the bot and the app's chat assistant answers —
  same persona (investor profile), live portfolio snapshot, analysis skills,
  web search and provider resolution (your saved BYOK key first, then the
  free chain with its shared daily cap) as the in-app side panel, on the same
  conversation thread (`chat.json`). `/clear` resets the thread, `/help`
  explains. Replies take ~30-90 s (a GitHub Actions runner cold-starts per
  burst of messages).

Users link Telegram from the Profile page (deep-link + `/start` code) and can
toggle each stream or disconnect there. Digest and alerts are two GitHub
Actions schedules (`.github/workflows/notify.yml`) running
`stocks digest --all-users` and `stocks alerts --all-users`. Chat is
event-driven: the bot has a **webhook** pointed at a tiny Cloudflare Worker
(`workers/telegram-webhook/`) that stores each update in the R2 bucket
(`data/tg_updates/`) and fires a `repository_dispatch`, which runs
`stocks telegram-chat` (`.github/workflows/telegram_chat.yml`) to drain and
answer the queue. In every job, accounts are discovered and restored from the
`[storage]` bucket, so the ephemeral runner needs no user data in git.

Setup (one-time):

1. @BotFather → `/newbot` → copy the token and the bot's username.
2. `cp .notify_secrets.env.example .notify_secrets.env`, paste the bot token,
   username, a random `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` and the four
   `STOCKS_STORAGE_*` values (same creds the Streamlit deploy uses).
3. `./scripts/setup_notify_secrets.sh` — pushes every GitHub Actions secret
   (harvesting `CHAT_ENC_KEY` and the `FREE_LLM_*` keys from your local
   `.streamlit/secrets.toml`) and prints the `[telegram]` block to add to
   the deploy's `secrets.toml`. Needs `gh auth login` once.
4. Deploy the webhook Worker and point the bot at it — see
   `workers/telegram-webhook/README.md`. Rollback any time with
   `uv run stocks telegram-chat --delete-webhook` (restores `getUpdates`
   polling).
5. Reboot the Streamlit app, link your account on the Profile page, then
   Actions → notifications → Run workflow → **test** to confirm delivery
   (see below).

Testing delivery, cheapest first:

- **In the app**: Profile → Notifications → *Send test message* — one message
  to the logged-in account, straight from the Streamlit deploy's
  `[telegram] bot_token`.
- **Locally**: `uv run stocks notify-test` sends through the env-configured
  channels (`TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`, `SMTP_*`) — the same path as
  `alerts --deliver`; `uv run stocks notify-test --all-users` walks the
  per-account fan-out the crons use (add `--user owner` for one account,
  `--dry-run` to list recipients without sending).
- **On the real runner**: Actions → notifications → Run workflow → job
  `test`, optionally with `user` and `dry_run`. This is the only check that
  exercises the Actions secrets and the bucket roster together, so run it
  after any secret rotation.

Other local smoke tests: `uv run stocks digest --dry-run`,
`uv run stocks telegram-chat --ask "how is my book?" --user owner`.

## Roadmap

- [x] Portfolio positions + P/L tracking (FIFO ledger + Spanish tax)
- [x] Portfolio analytics (allocation, concentration, beta/vol/drawdown, benchmarks)
- [x] Watchlist screener (rank/filter by KPIs)
- [x] Earnings calendar + reminders
- [x] Alert upgrades (%move, drawdown, RSI, SMA cross, 52w) + Telegram/email delivery
- [x] Per-user Telegram notifications: daily digest + hourly price alerts (GitHub Actions cron)
- [x] Telegram assistant chat: webhook → Cloudflare Worker → R2 queue → Actions, same engine/thread as the in-app chat
- [ ] Desktop / push (mobile) notifications on alert hits
- [ ] More indicators (MACD, Bollinger)
- [ ] Backtesting simple strategies
