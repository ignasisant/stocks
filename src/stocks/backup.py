"""Point-in-time snapshots of the persistence bucket, and their restore path.

The bucket behind stocks.storage is a mirror, not a backup: every write —
including a corrupt portfolio.db or a bad migration — syncs to it immediately
and replaces the only copy. R2 has no bucket versioning, so this module keeps
history the plain way: a daily (cron) or on-demand server-side copy of every
live object under a stamped prefix,

    backups/2026-08-31T04-17-02Z/data/users/<slug>/portfolio.db
    backups/2026-08-31T04-17-02Z/watchlist.yaml
    ...

and a restore that copies one stamp's tree back over the live keys. Copies are
CopyObject calls — no object bytes ever travel through the job runner.

Run from the CLI (`stocks backup run|list|restore`) and from the scheduled
workflow (.github/workflows/backup.yml). Everything here needs [storage]
configured; without it the commands refuse rather than silently do nothing.
