"""BaFin directors' dealings — Art. 19 MAR managers' transactions (Germany).

The German half of what `insiders.py` does for the US. Form 4 is a US-only
artifact, so a Frankfurt or Xetra line degrades to an empty insider section no
matter how much its board is buying. MAR Article 19 is the EU equivalent —
officers, directors and people closely associated with them must notify the
issuer and the national regulator within three business days — and BaFin
republishes every German notification in a public database.

That database exports its result table as XML (displaytag's `export` hook), so
one GET per issuer yields the same fields Form 4 carries: who, their role, buy
or sell, the date, the venue, the average price and the aggregated volume.
Volume is a money amount in BaFin's export, not a share count, so shares are
derived (volume / price) to match `InsiderTx`.

Coverage note: German issuers only, and only notifications published within the
last twelve months — BaFin drops older rows. Rows are EUR-denominated, so
`InsiderTx.currency` says EUR here where EDGAR rows say USD.
