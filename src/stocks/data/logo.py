"""Resolve company logo image URLs for the dashboard.

Preference order, best-looking first:
  1. FMP  — a real transparent-PNG logo keyed straight off the *ticker*
            (the same source TIKR-style dashboards use); no key needed for
            the image path, and no yfinance round-trip to find a domain.
  2. Google favicon — low-res, but always returns *something*, keyed off the
            company website domain (yfinance lookup).

(Clearbit used to sit between the two; HubSpot shut the API down, so it was
dropped — the v3 cache bump re-resolves entries that still point there.)

Each candidate is probed once *from this host*. Only definitive answers — a
working image, or a hard 404 on every source — are cached to data/logos.json;
an inconclusive probe (403/429/timeout: FMP/Yahoo block datacenter IPs, which
is exactly what a cloud deploy runs on) is kept in memory for the process
only, and the best-guess URL is still returned so the *browser* (a
residential IP) gets a chance. The next boot re-probes. The cache is
versioned: bump CACHE_VERSION to force every ticker to re-resolve.
