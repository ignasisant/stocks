"""FX via frankfurter.dev (ECB reference rates, no key).

Spot rates for live sizing; historical rates for cost-basis / tax reporting.
Spanish tax law converts every foreign-currency transaction to EUR at the ECB
rate published for the transaction date, so historical lookups are cached and
resolve weekends/holidays to the prior business day (frankfurter's behaviour).

A currency the ECB does not quote but that is hard-pegged to one it does (see
`PEGS`) resolves through its anchor at the fixed parity, so every entry point
here accepts it as a base or a quote.
