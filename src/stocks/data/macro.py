"""Macro series without an API key — FRED's chart CSV and Eurostat's HICP API.

Two open endpoints carry everything the market-pulse page needs beyond price
data, and neither wants a registration:

* **FRED** serves any series its charts can draw as CSV —
  ``fredgraph.csv?id=DGS10`` — so the whole US rates/credit/inflation side
  arrives without the keyed `fred/series/observations` API: nominal and real
  yields, the 2s10s and 3m10y curves, high-yield and investment-grade OAS,
  breakevens, both policy rates, CPI. `cosd` trims the download to the window
  actually plotted (DGS10's full history is 16k rows).
* **Eurostat** serves HICP per country. The dataset code matters more than it
  looks: ``prc_hicp_manr`` (ECOICOP v1) froze at 2025-12 when the February
  2026 methodology change landed, and the live series is ``prc_hicp_minr``
  (ECOICOP v2), whose item dimension is named ``coicop18`` — ``TOTAL`` for
  headline, ``TOT_X_NRG_FOOD`` for core. Query the old code and you get a
  200 with data that looks current and is nine months stale, which is why both
  codes are pinned here next to this note.

Euro-area HICP and US CPI do not publish on the same calendar (a flash
estimate lands weeks before the US print), so every row this module returns
carries its own reference period. Nothing here aligns them into one column.

Responses are cached to disk under ``data/macro/`` for six hours — these are
daily-at-best series. A failed refresh falls back to the stale file rather
than raising: a throttled host should show yesterday's yield curve, not an
empty card.
