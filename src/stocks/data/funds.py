"""ETFs and traded funds — what they are, and what stands in for fundamentals.

A fund is a wrapper, not a business: it has no revenue, no EBIT, no insider
filings and no earnings date, so every fundamental surface in the app either
prints n/a for one (the KPI grid, the screener) or invents a shape that isn't
there (a moat score for VWCE). The three things a fund holder actually needs —
what it costs to hold, what it holds, and what that basket is exposed to —
were nowhere.

This module is the fund half of the instrument model, mirroring
stocks.data.crypto: a cheap classifier the render paths can gate on, and one
profile fetch that carries the fund's own numbers.

**Classification** keys off Yahoo's ``quoteType`` (ETF / MUTUALFUND), learned
once per symbol and kept in ``data/quote_types.json`` — an instrument's kind
is a global fact, not per-account, and it does not change, so the cache never
expires. `KNOWN_FUNDS` seeds it with the funds a European retail investor
actually meets (US majors plus the UCITS lines sold in Spain), which means the
common cases classify with no network at all. Everything else costs one
``.info`` call, once, and callers on hot paths pass ``fetch=False`` to get a
cache-only answer.

**Units** are normalised here because Yahoo is not consistent about them:
``fundOperations`` reports the expense ratio as a fraction (0.000945) while
``info.netExpenseRatio`` reports the same number as a percent (0.0945). Both
become a fraction. Two Yahoo fields are deliberately NOT surfaced: the
``Total Net Assets`` row of ``fundOperations`` (it repeats the category
average, so it is the sleeve's size, not the fund's) and ``equityHoldings``
valuation averages (UCITS lines report them reciprocated — a P/E of 0.0434 —
and a reciprocal that is silently wrong is worse than a blank).
