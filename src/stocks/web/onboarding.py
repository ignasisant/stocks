"""Guided tour and per-release "what's new", both driven by one step registry.

Two surfaces over the same data:

* the **tour** — a modal that walks a new account through the app one feature
  at a time, and for the connectable ones (ledger import, AI key, Telegram,
  tax residence) says whether this account has it switched on and takes the
  user to the page where it is switched on.
* **what's new** — the same modal in a different mode, listing the releases
  the account has not seen yet. `RELEASES` carries the changelog as data and
  each entry names the tour steps its items belong to, so a new feature is
  announced and explained by the same copy.

Three design points worth knowing before editing this:

1. **One dialog per script run.** Streamlit allows exactly one open modal, so
   this module and `auth.maybe_prompt_profile()` cannot both fire on the same
   run. app.py gives the tour priority (`maybe_open()` returns True when it
   claims the run) — the investor profile is a tour step anyway.
2. **Navigating closes the modal.** `st.switch_page` ends the run, and a modal
   cannot survive it. So "take me there" does not try to stay open: it queues
   the step (`_GOTO`), the next full run navigates, and the tour reappears as a
   thin *resume strip* above the page body. That strip — not the modal — is
   what makes "go and look at it" work at all.
3. **A dialog is a fragment.** Back/Next are `on_click` callbacks so they rerun
   only the modal; the buttons that must leave it (take me there, finish, exit)
   call `st.rerun()` for a full-app rerun, which is what lets app.py act on the
   queued step.

Progress lives in prefs.json for signed-in accounts and in session state for
guests: the guest data dir is shared by every anonymous visitor, so writing a
guest's tour progress there would hand it to the next stranger.
