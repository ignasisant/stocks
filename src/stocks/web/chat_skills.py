"""Skill library for the assistant panel (web/chat_core.py).

A *skill* is a markdown file in web/skills/ holding an analysis framework the
model should apply to a question — a sector lens (tech, energy…), a style lens
(value, technical…) or a task recipe (earnings review, Spain tax…). The file's
frontmatter carries the id, an English display name (used as the heading inside
the system prompt) and a one-line description that doubles as the classifier
catalog entry; the body is the framework itself. Bodies are English because the
system prompt is English regardless of UI language — the UI label is localized
separately under the ``chat.skill.<id>`` locale keys.

Auto mode routes every message through the provider's cheapest model
(``Provider.classifier_model``): the catalog plus the question go in, a JSON
list of at most MAX_AUTO skill ids comes out. Any failure — network, bad JSON,
unknown ids — degrades to "no skills", never blocks the answer.

This module is deliberately streamlit-free so it stays trivially testable; all
UI (mode picker, multiselect, lens captions) lives in chat_core.
