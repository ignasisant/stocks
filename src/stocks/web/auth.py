"""Login gate and per-user data resolution for the web app.

Authentication is Streamlit-native OIDC (st.login / st.user) configured in
.streamlit/secrets.toml under [auth] — see the README "Login (web app)"
section for the required keys.

Browsing is public: app.py calls resolve_user() before building the
navigation, which maps anonymous visitors to a shared read-only guest dir
(data/users/_guest/) seeded with the starter watchlist and the demo ledger.
Login is required only where personal data is read or written — the Import
and Profile pages call require_login() at the top, the Portfolio page calls
require_login_or_demo() (own book signed in, demo book as a guest), and
mutating widgets (favorites, tags, watchlist editor) check is_logged_in().

Every account gets its own data under data/users/<slug>/ — watchlist.yaml,
portfolio.db, last_import.json, prefs.json — keyed by the verified OIDC
email. The optional [app].owner_email account maps to the repo-root files
instead (watchlist.yaml, data/portfolio.db), so the CLI — which is
single-user and always works on the root files — stays in sync with the
owner's web session. Broker-code aliases stay global (root watchlist.yaml):
they're reference data, not personal data.
