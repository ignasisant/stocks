"""Web search for the assistant panel.

Keyless like the free chain: DuckDuckGo via the ``ddgs`` package, no API key
and no per-search billing. A *planner* call through the provider's cheapest
model (the same pattern as the skill auto-router) decides per message whether
the answer needs fresh information from the web and emits at most MAX_QUERIES
search queries; the hits are appended to the outgoing copy of the user's
message — not the system prompt, so provider prompt caches stay warm — and the
system prompt (chat/engine.system_prompt) tells the model to ground on them and
cite URLs.

The top hits are then *opened*: their article text (not DDG's two-sentence
snippet) is what reaches the model, which is the difference between citing a
headline and citing what the page actually says. Boilerplate removal is
trafilatura's (optional dep, lxml fallback below) — with only _PAGE_CHARS of
each page reaching the prompt, nav and cookie walls are budget stolen from
the numbers. Links the user pastes skip
the planner entirely and are always read.

Everything degrades to "no web": a missing ddgs install, a search error or an
empty result set all yield [], and the answer proceeds on the model's own
knowledge plus the app context. A planner *failure* is the one case that does
not silently drop the web — a keyword heuristic (`heuristic_queries`) takes
over, so a dead classifier model costs relevance, not internet access.
