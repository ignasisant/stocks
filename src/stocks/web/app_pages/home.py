"""Home page — the daily glance: what's new plus the key portfolio metrics.

The AI "Daily action" card opens the page — one briefing a day on what to look
at, see web/daily_ui.py. Then the Portfolio page's headline metrics (cost
basis, market value, unrealised & realised P/L, then today / 1 week / 1 month
deltas) with a range-selectable value-vs-injected sparkline and a movers card
(1d/1w/1m gainers and losers), then "What's new" cards (watchlist big moves,
earnings, recent transactions, 52-week extremes), then the watchlist groups
collapsed into expanders. Every ticker cell links to the Ticker page; the full
ledger analytics stay on Portfolio.
