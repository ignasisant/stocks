"""Portfolio page — driven entirely by the transaction ledger (data/portfolio.db).

Upload a Revolut CSV on the Import page first; everything here derives from
those transactions via FIFO: open positions & P/L, allocation & risk, realized
gains & Spanish tax, and dividends. Weights are put on an EUR footing so a
multi-currency book (USD + EUR) is measured consistently.

Tabs are dynamic (on_change="rerun"): only the visible tab's content runs, so
the price/profile fetch behind "Allocation & risk" doesn't block the others.
The Positions tab's two sections are parallel fragments, so the live-price
table and the ledger-history chart load concurrently on a full rerun.
