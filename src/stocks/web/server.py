"""ASGI entry point: the static marketing site in front of the Streamlit app.

Run: uv run stocks dashboard   (or: uv run streamlit run src/stocks/web/server.py)

`streamlit run` detects the module-level `st.App` and serves it directly, so
this is one process on one port — the app exactly as before, plus a handful of
plain Starlette routes it now shares the server with:

    /              the landing (English), or the app for a visitor who has one
    /es/           the landing (Spanish)
    /lp/*          the landing's own assets — brand mark, share card
    /robots.txt    crawl rules, generated for whatever host we answer on
    /sitemap.xml   both landing URLs, cross-linked by hreflang
    /livez         liveness probe for uptime checks (scripts/setup_monitoring.sh)
    /healthz       the same probe, for local runs and the Docker HEALTHCHECK
    /legal/*       privacy policy and terms of use (static, bilingual)
    everything else    Streamlit: /portfolio, /ticker, /_stcore/…, /oauth2callback

Why `/` is shared rather than the app moving to a prefix: the app's default
page is served at the root by Streamlit and nothing can move it (`st.Page`
ignores `url_path` for the default page), so putting the landing anywhere else
would mean `server.baseUrlPath` — which rewrites every app URL, invalidates
every bookmark, and changes the OIDC redirect URI registered with Google. The
gate below avoids all of that: a request for `/` gets the landing only when it
carries no query parameter and no `ts_app` cookie, which is exactly the state
of a first-time visitor and of every crawler. Any CTA click arrives with a
parameter, and the cookie keeps returning visitors going straight to the app.

Crawlers never send cookies, so the pages Google sees at `/` and `/es/` are the
pages a first-time human sees. The app routes are marked `noindex` on the way
out, because they are a JavaScript shell over somebody's positions.
