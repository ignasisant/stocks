"""Transient data-fetch notices, rendered as auto-dismissing toasts.

Yahoo throttles datacenter egress IPs and plain urllib fetchers
(FX, logos) die on a dropped network, so a fetch failure is routine rather than
exceptional. The section that failed degrades in place — empty state, dimmed
cells — and calls `data_toast()` to say why. `st.toast` self-dismisses after 4s
("short"), so a transient miss never leaves a permanent banner in the layout;
app.py's CSS parks the toast bottom-left, clear of the chat launcher.

Why every fetch site handles its own failure instead of leaning on the
try/except around `page.run()` in app.py: most fetching sections are
`st.fragment`s. A fragment rerun (switching the ticker chart period, flipping
the financials view) re-executes only the fragment function — app.py is not on
the stack — so an exception raised inside one bypasses that guard entirely and
surfaces as Streamlit's crash card. The app-level guard remains only as a
backstop for the non-fragment page body.

Parallel fragments (`st.fragment(parallel=True)`) add a second trap: during the
initial page load they run on worker threads, and Streamlit refuses any write
that lands outside the fragment's own container. `st.toast` writes to the
page-level event container, so the toast itself raised StreamlitAPIException
from inside the `except` that was meant to degrade — a Yahoo throttle crashed
the Positions tab. `data_toast()` therefore falls back to an inline caption in
the calling fragment when the toast is refused, so every call site is safe
without knowing whether it runs in parallel.
