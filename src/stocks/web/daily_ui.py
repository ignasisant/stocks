"""The Home page's "Daily action" card — Streamlit over stocks.chat.daily.

One briefing per account per day: a headline, three or four schematic lines,
and the tickers they are about. The reasoning, the prompt and the fallback all
live in the headless module; this file owns the session, the stored copy and
the paint.

The card is rendered into a deferred slot (web/skeletons.py). Home reserves it
high on the page and calls `render()` at the very bottom of the script, so a
day whose briefing still has to be generated shimmers a card-shaped
placeholder in the right place while the rest of the dashboard paints — and
the LLM call, which happens at most once a day, never sits in front of the
numbers.

Generation is attempted at most once per session per action day: a provider
that is down stays down for the next few seconds, and retrying on every rerun
would spend the account's free allowance on the same failure. The computed
fallback fills the card meanwhile, so the section is never empty.

And it runs in a thread. A provider that answers inside GRACE_S still lands in
the first paint; a slower one is handed to the background, the computed card
goes up immediately with a line saying a briefing is still being written, and
a timed fragment swaps the real one in when it arrives. The script run
therefore ends in seconds instead of holding the whole page open — and an open
run is a page nothing on it can be clicked on — for daily.TIMEOUT_S.
