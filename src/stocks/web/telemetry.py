"""Streamlit glue for stocks.obs — who/what/where for every dashboard run.

app.py calls `bind_run()` once per script run; every log record emitted after
it (from any module, including the page bodies and the chat engine) carries the
same `session`, `user` and `page` fields, so one production incident can be
pulled up as a timeline:

    stocks logs tail --user ignasi484_gmail_com_1a2b3c4d --since 2h

`user` is the auth slug, not the raw address — the same opaque-ish key the
account's data directory uses, so a log line points straight at the files
involved. Set STOCKS_LOG_USER=0 to keep even that out of the logs.
