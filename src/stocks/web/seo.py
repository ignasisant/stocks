"""Search and social metadata for the static landing pages.

Everything here exists because the landing is served as a real HTML document
(see `landing_static` and `server`) rather than rendered inside the Streamlit
app: a Streamlit page owns exactly one `<head>` for the whole app, which no
script run can add a description, a canonical URL or Open Graph tags to. A
plain Starlette response can.

Three things are worth knowing about the choices below.

* **Two indexable URLs, not one with a parameter.** English lives at `/`,
  Spanish at `/es/`, and each declares the other with `hreflang` (plus an
  `x-default` pointing at English). Serving both languages from `/` off the
  Accept-Language header would leave one of them with no address to rank.
* **The app is deliberately not indexed.** `/`, `/es/` and the assets are the
  only public documents; every app route is a JavaScript shell over somebody's
  positions, so `robots_txt()` disallows them and `server` stamps an
  `X-Robots-Tag: noindex` header on them. `/` is both the landing and the app
  entry (a query parameter or the returning-visitor cookie switches it), and
  crawlers send neither, so allowing `/` cannot expose the app.
* **The absolute base URL comes from the request.** This app is deployed at
  whatever hostname it happens to get (a `*.run.app` URL today), and canonical
  / Open Graph tags must be absolute. `server.base_url()` derives it per
  request from the forwarded headers, so nothing here hard-codes a host.
