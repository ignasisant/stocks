"""The landing page as a standalone HTML document.

`landing` builds the markup, `seo` builds the metadata, and this module is the
document that puts them together — the thing `server.py` writes to the socket
for `GET /` and `GET /es/`.

Why a document at all, when the same markup used to render inside the app: a
Streamlit page cannot own its `<head>`. No script run can set a title, a
description, a canonical URL or an Open Graph image, because by the time the
script runs the browser has already been served Streamlit's own shell. It also
cannot be read without JavaScript, and the shell has to boot a websocket before
the first pixel of copy appears. Serving the bytes directly fixes all of that at
once: the copy is in the response, the metadata is in the head, and the app
starts only when a visitor asks for it.

Two details that follow from being static:

* **Everything is inline.** One request, no render-blocking asset of our own —
  the tokens, the stylesheet and the reveal script all ship in the document.
  The only external request is the font stylesheet, preconnected in `seo.head`.
* **The phone check moved into the page.** The app version asked
  `widgets.is_mobile()` on the server; a cached static document cannot, so the
  User-Agent block ships disabled (`media="not all"`) and a one-line script
  enables it for phone User-Agents before the first paint. The width-driven
  640px block in the stylesheet is unaffected and does the real work.
