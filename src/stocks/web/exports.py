"""Ledger export — the CSV the Profile page hands back.

The privacy policy promises the data is the account's own to take away, and
"take away" has to mean a file, not a screenshot of a table. The one thing
worth doing here beyond dumping the rows is the conversion: the app reckons in
the account's reference currency, so an export whose amounts are still in five
native currencies is not the book the user sees. Every row carries the ECB
rate for its OWN trade date and the converted amount alongside the original.
