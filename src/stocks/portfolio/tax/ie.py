"""Ireland — CGT on shares, and the 41% exit tax on funds.

Scope: disposals by an Irish-resident, ordinarily resident and domiciled
individual. NOT tax advice — a planning aid. Rules encoded:

* **33% CGT** on the net chargeable gain, after the **personal exemption of
  €1,270** (s.601 TCA 1997). The exemption is per person, cannot be
  transferred to a spouse and cannot be carried forward — an unused one is
  simply gone.
* **FIFO matching** (s.580 TCA 1997), which is what positions.py does by
  default.
* **The four-week rule** (s.581): a loss on shares reacquired within four
  weeks *after* the disposal is not available generally — only against a gain
  on the disposal of those reacquired shares. The window is forward-only,
  unlike Spain's two months or the US 30 days either side, so this module
  uses `days_after_window`. The loss is deferred, not lost, and comes back as
  the replacement shares are themselves sold.
* **Funds are a different regime.** Irish and EU-domiciled UCITS (ETFs
  included) sit in gross roll-up: gains are charged at **41% exit tax**, with
  no annual exemption, and a loss on them is **not allowable against anything**
  — plus a deemed disposal every eight years. Applied to the tickers the
  caller classified as funds (`TaxSettings.fund_tickers`); with no
  classification everything is treated as shares and the tab says so.
* **Losses** carry forward indefinitely, against chargeable gains only.

Not modelled: the deemed disposal itself (it needs each fund's NAV on the
eighth anniversary), the four-week rule's *matching* leg (shares bought and
sold inside four weeks are matched against each other before FIFO), whether a
particular ETF is EU/Irish-domiciled — a US-domiciled one is CGT, not exit tax
— development-land rules, and PRSA/PRSI interactions.
