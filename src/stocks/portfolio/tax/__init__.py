"""Tax jurisdictions: pick one, get a period summarizer and reporting flags.

    from stocks.portfolio import tax
    j = tax.get("US")
    period = j.fiscal_year(realized, 2025, buy_dates, tax.TaxSettings(...))
    period.estimated_tax, period.kpis(), j.reporting_flags(foreign_value)

The ledger must be replayed in the jurisdiction's own currency *and* under its
own share-identification rule — `j.currency` and `j.matching` feed
`positions.build(txs, base=…, matching=…)`, so a US filer's basis is USD at the
trade date, a Canadian's is an averaged CAD cost base and an Italian's is LIFO.
`j.year_start` moves the year boundary where it is not 1 January (6 April in
the UK, 1 July in Australia).

Adding a country means one module here plus its `portfolio.<code>_*` catalog
keys; nothing in the web or CLI layer branches on the code.
