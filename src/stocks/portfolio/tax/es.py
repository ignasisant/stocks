"""Spain — IRPF savings base (base del ahorro) on securities.

Scope: capital gains/losses on securities. NOT tax advice — a planning aid.
Key rules encoded:

* Progressive savings-base brackets (2023-2025 scale).
* FIFO matching lives in positions.py (art. 37 LIRPF).
* Art. 33.5.f "regla de los dos meses": a loss on listed securities is NOT
  deductible in the year if identical securities were (re)bought within the two
  months before or after the sale. The loss is deferred, not lost — it becomes
  computable as the replacement shares are later sold, which the shared
  `repurchases` machinery re-integrates. Only as many shares as were bought
  back are blocked: a partial buy-back defers that proportion of the loss.
* Losses offset gains within the savings base; any excess carries forward 4
  years (surfaced as a note, not auto-applied across years here).
* Modelo 720 / foreign-asset reporting flag (> 50.000 EUR held abroad).
