"""United Kingdom — capital gains tax on shares.

Scope: CGT on listed shares held outside an ISA or SIPP by a UK-resident
individual. NOT tax advice — a planning aid. Rules encoded:

* **Share identification** happens in positions.py, not here: same-day, then
  the 30 days after the disposal, then the Section 104 pool at average cost
  (TCGA 1992 s.105/106A, `build(matching="s104")`). It is a matching rule, not
  a disallowance — the 30-day match is *why* selling and buying back a week
  later banks no loss, and the parcel it produces simply has a different cost.
* **The tax year runs 6 April to 5 April.** "2025" here means 2025/26, so a
  disposal in February 2026 belongs to it — see `base.covers`/`tax_year_of`.
* **Annual Exempt Amount**: £3,000 (2024/25 and 2025/26, down from £6,000 and
  £12,300 before that). Current-year losses come off gains *before* the AEA,
  which is how a loss-making year can waste the allowance entirely.
* **Rates**: 18% on gains falling inside what is left of the basic-rate band,
  24% above it (both from 30 October 2024; 10%/20% before that). The gain
  stacks on top of taxable income, so `TaxSettings.other_income` decides where
  the 24% starts.
* **Losses** carry forward indefinitely once claimed. Brought-forward losses
  may only reduce gains down to the AEA — this module computes one year at a
  time, so that restriction is surfaced as a note rather than applied.

Not modelled: the £50,000 proceeds reporting test is reported as a note but
not as an obligation; no ISA/SIPP wrappers (nothing in a wrapper is taxable and
nothing here knows which account a trade sat in), no business asset disposal
relief, no negligible-value claims, and no personal-allowance taper above
£100,000 of income.
