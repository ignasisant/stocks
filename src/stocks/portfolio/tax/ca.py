"""Canada — taxable capital gains on securities.

Scope: dispositions of listed securities in a non-registered account by a
Canadian-resident individual. NOT tax advice — a planning aid. Rules encoded:

* **Adjusted cost base.** Identical properties are one holding at one average
  cost (ITA s.47), recomputed on every purchase — `build(matching="average")`.
  A Canadian basis is therefore never a specific lot's price, which is exactly
  what people get wrong when they reuse a FIFO report.
* **50% inclusion rate.** Half the net capital gain is taxable income (ITA
  s.38); the other half is never taxed. The 2024 proposal to raise the rate to
  two thirds above $250,000 was cancelled in March 2025, so one rate applies.
* **Marginal rates.** The taxable half stacks on the other income you set in
  Profile, at the federal brackets below, plus a flat provincial rate you give
  (`TaxSettings.subnational_rate`) — provincial tax is roughly half the bill
  and no federal-only estimate is worth reading without it.
* **Superficial loss** (s.40(2)(g)(i)): a loss is denied when identical
  property is bought within 30 days before or after the disposition and still
  held at the end of that window. The denied loss is not lost — it is added to
  the replacement's ACB, so it comes back when *those* shares are sold, which
  is how this module re-integrates it.
* **Losses** offset capital gains only — never ordinary income — and carry
  forward indefinitely (a three-year carryback exists; it is a note here).

Not modelled: the "still held at day 30" leg of the superficial-loss test (a
repurchase inside the window is treated as denying the loss), provincial
surtaxes and progressivity behind the single rate you supply, the alternative
minimum tax, RRSP/TFSA/FHSA accounts (nothing in them is taxable), and
foreign-exchange gains on the cash itself. Federal rates are the 2025 tables.
