"""Australia — capital gains tax on shares, with the 50% discount.

Scope: CGT events A1 (disposals) on listed shares held by an Australian
resident individual outside super. NOT tax advice — a planning aid. Rules
encoded:

* **The income year runs 1 July to 30 June.** "2025" here means 2025-26, so a
  disposal in May 2026 belongs to it — see `base.covers`/`tax_year_of`.
* **50% CGT discount** on assets held more than 12 months (ITAA 1997 Div. 115).
  Not a lower rate: half the gain simply drops out, and the rest is ordinary
  taxable income.
* **Order of operations.** Capital losses come off the *gross* gains before the
  discount is applied (s.102-5), and you may choose which gains they hit
  first. Applying them to the non-discounted gains first leaves more of the
  discountable gain intact, which is the choice this module makes — it is the
  taxpayer's to make, and it is always the better one.
* **Marginal rates**, since the gain is ordinary income: the resident scale
  below plus the 2% Medicare levy, stacked on the other income you set in
  Profile.
* **FIFO** matching. Australia lets you identify the exact shares you sold, and
  the ATO accepts FIFO when your records don't; that is what positions.py
  does.
* **Losses** offset capital gains only — never salary — and carry forward
  indefinitely.

Not modelled: choosing specific parcels to sell (a real planning lever here),
the Medicare levy's low-income shading-in and the levy surcharge, the
non-resident and temporary-resident rules, the small-business and
main-residence concessions, super contributions, and franking credits on the
dividends this tab does not cover. Rates are the 2024-25 / 2025-26 scale.
