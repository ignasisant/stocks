"""France — plus-values de cession de valeurs mobilières under the PFU.

Scope: realized gains and losses on securities held directly (compte-titres
ordinaire) by a French-resident individual. NOT tax advice — a planning aid.
Rules encoded:

* **Prélèvement forfaitaire unique**, 30% all in: 12.8% income tax plus 17.2%
  prélèvements sociaux (CSG 9.2, CRDS 0.5, prélèvement de solidarité 7.5). The
  split matters — the two halves are assessed and paid differently — so both
  are shown rather than one blended rate.
* **Prix moyen pondéré d'acquisition** (CGI art. 150-0 D, 3): identical
  securities are one holding at one weighted-average cost, recomputed on every
  purchase. That is `build(matching="average")`, and it is why a French cost
  basis is nobody's individual purchase price.
* **Losses** offset gains of the same nature in the year and carry forward
  **10 years** (art. 150-0 D, 11). They can never touch other income.
* **No annual allowance**: the first euro of net gain is taxed.
* Foreign accounts must be declared (formulaire 3916/3916-bis) whatever they
  hold — a duty at any amount, hence a flag with no threshold to cross.

Not modelled: the option for the barème progressif (art. 200 A, 2 — it is a
whole-return, irrevocable choice covering every investment income of the year,
which this app cannot see), the abattement for securities acquired before 2018
that goes with it, the CEHR on high incomes (3%/4%, surfaced as a note), the
PEA and assurance-vie wrappers, and the 500,000 € apport-cession regimes.
