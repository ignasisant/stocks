"""Italy — imposta sostitutiva on plusvalenze from securities.

Scope: realized gains and losses on listed shares and funds held by an
Italian-resident individual outside a business. NOT tax advice — a planning
aid. Rules encoded:

* **Flat 26% substitute tax** on the net capital gain (art. 5 D.Lgs. 461/1997).
  Equities and funds alike; the 12.5% rate for white-list government bonds is
  out of scope here.
* **LIFO matching** (art. 67 c. 1-bis TUIR): the shares disposed of are the
  most recently acquired ones. That is `build(matching="lifo")`, and in a
  rising market it books a *smaller* gain than FIFO on identical trades — the
  reason this app cannot just reuse its default replay for an Italian filer.
* **Losses** (minusvalenze) offset gains of the same nature and carry forward
  **four years** (art. 68 c. 5 TUIR). They never touch other income, and an
  unused fourth-year loss simply expires.
* **No annual allowance**: the first euro of net gain is taxed.
* **Quadro RW** monitors assets held abroad and is where **IVAFE** — 0.2% a
  year of their value — is assessed. A duty at any amount for securities,
  hence a flag with no threshold to cross.

Not modelled: the difference between the three regimes (in *risparmio
amministrato* or *gestito* the broker withholds and nets your losses for you,
so nothing reaches quadro RT; only the *dichiarativo* regime makes you compute
this yourself), the imposta di bollo on Italian custody statements, and the
special rules for qualified holdings and non-white-list jurisdictions.
