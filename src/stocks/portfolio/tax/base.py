"""Jurisdiction-neutral tax scaffolding shared by every country module.

The engine used to be one Spain-only module (`tax_es`). Two things are country
specific and everything else turned out not to be:

* **Which losses count this year.** Both jurisdictions we ship disallow a loss
  when the same security is bought back around the sale — Spain's art. 33.5.f
  "regla de los dos meses" and the US wash-sale rule (30 days either side).
  The mechanics are identical: block the loss in the sale year, re-integrate
  it as the replacement shares are themselves sold. Only the window differs,
  so `replacement_dates`/`recovered_losses` take the window as a predicate.
* **What the net is taxed at.** A flat progressive scale over one base (Spain)
  versus two buckets split by holding period, netted against each other, with
  the remainder deductible against ordinary income up to a cap (US).

So a jurisdiction is: a currency, a period summarizer, a bracket function and
a set of reporting-threshold flags. The web/CLI layers render whatever
`TaxPeriod.kpis()` and `.notes()` return, which is why adding a country does
not touch the tax tab.

Money is in the jurisdiction's own currency (`Jurisdiction.currency`) — the
ledger is replayed at that base, so a US filer's basis is USD at the trade
date, a Spanish filer's is EUR at the ECB rate. NOT tax advice; a planning aid.
