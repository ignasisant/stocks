"""United States — federal capital-gains tax on securities.

Scope: realized gains/losses on securities for an individual filer. NOT tax
advice — a planning aid, federal only (no state tax, no AMT, no QSBS/collectible
rates, no Section 1256 or option straddles). Rules encoded:

* **Holding period.** Long-term when the lot was held *more than* one year
  (sold on or before the anniversary is short-term). Lots come from the FIFO
  replay in positions.py; specific-lot identification is not modelled, so this
  is the "no election / broker default" answer.
* **Wash sale (IRC 1091).** A loss is disallowed when substantially identical
  stock is bought within 30 days before or after the sale. The loss is not
  lost: it bumps the basis of the replacement shares, so it comes back when
  those are sold — the shared `repurchases` machinery re-integrates it,
  keeping the original loss's short/long character. Buying back fewer shares
  than were sold washes only that many (Treas. Reg. 1.1091-1(c)).
* **Netting (IRC 1222).** Short-term and long-term buckets net internally,
  then against each other. A net short-term gain is taxed at ordinary rates
  (stacked on `TaxSettings.other_income`); a net long-term gain at the 0/15/20
  preferential rates, stacked above ordinary taxable income.
* **Net capital loss (IRC 1211(b)).** Deductible against ordinary income up to
  $3,000 a year ($1,500 married filing separately); the rest carries forward
  indefinitely, retaining character.
* **NIIT (IRC 1411).** Optional 3.8% on net investment income above the MAGI
  threshold. Off by default: it needs income we don't hold.
* **Reporting flags.** FBAR (FinCEN 114, $10,000 aggregate foreign accounts)
  and Form 8938 ($50k/$75k single, $100k/$150k joint) — thresholds crossed,
  not filings due: both look at foreign *accounts*, and a US-held brokerage
  account full of foreign stocks is not one.

Rate tables are keyed by tax year (2025 = Rev. Proc. 2024-40 as amended by the
2025 reconciliation act, which kept the seven-bracket structure). A year with
no table falls back to the closest earlier one, so the numbers age visibly
rather than silently: check `BRACKET_YEARS` before trusting a future year.
