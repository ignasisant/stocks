"""Portugal — mais-valias on securities (categoria G do IRS).

Scope: realized gains and losses on securities held by a Portuguese-resident
individual. NOT tax advice — a planning aid. Rules encoded:

* **28% special rate** (art. 72 CIRS) on the annual *saldo* between mais-valias
  and menos-valias. There is no allowance: the first euro of a positive saldo
  is taxed.
* **FIFO matching** (art. 43 n.6 a) CIRS): the securities sold are the ones
  held longest, which is what positions.py does by default.
* **Mandatory aggregation of short-term gains.** Since 2023 (Lei 24-D/2022),
  the part of the saldo from securities held **less than 365 days** must be
  *englobado* — added to your other income and taxed at the marginal rate —
  when total taxable income reaches the top IRS bracket. That is the one place
  where `TaxSettings.other_income` changes a Portuguese bill, and why the
  holding period is split out here at all.
* **Losses** carry forward **five years**, but only if you opt for englobamento
  in the year of the loss (art. 55 n.1 d) CIRS) — a choice this module cannot
  make for you, so it is a note.

Not modelled: the solidarity surcharge (2.5% above €80,000 of taxable income,
5% above €250,000 — a note when aggregation applies), the 50% relief for
micro/small-company shares, the 35% rate for blacklisted jurisdictions, the
non-habitual-resident and ex-residente regimes, and the fact that the AT wants
foreign amounts at its own reference rates rather than the ECB's.
