"""Germany — Abgeltungsteuer on capital income from securities.

Scope: realized gains/losses on securities for a private investor holding them
outside a business. NOT tax advice — a planning aid. Rules encoded:

* **Flat rate.** 25% Abgeltungsteuer (§32d EStG), plus the 5.5% solidarity
  surcharge *on the tax* (25% × 1.055 = 26.375%), plus church tax at 8% or 9%
  of the tax where the filer pays it. Church tax is deductible, which §32d(1)
  settles inside the assessment (`e / (4 + k)`), so the all-in rate is 27.82%
  at 8% and 27.99% at 9% — not 25% × 1.135/1.145.
* **FIFO.** §20(4) S.7 EStG matches the oldest lots first, which is what
  positions.py already does — no matching mode needed, and no wash-sale rule
  exists here, so a repurchase never blocks a loss.
* **Two loss circles (§20(6) EStG).** Losses on *shares* may only be set
  against gains on shares; everything else (funds, certificates, bonds) offsets
  capital income generally — including share gains. Both carry forward
  indefinitely, and the two carryforwards stay separate.
* **Teilfreistellung (§20 InvStG).** 30% of an equity fund's gain is exempt —
  and so is 30% of its loss, which is the half people forget. Applied to the
  tickers the caller classified as funds (`TaxSettings.fund_tickers`); with no
  classification the figures are computed without it and say so.
* **Sparer-Pauschbetrag.** €1,000 a year, €2,000 for a joint return, against
  the net positive capital income.

Not modelled: the Vorabpauschale on accumulating funds (it needs each fund's
year-end NAV and the Basiszins, neither of which is in a broker statement), the
Günstigerprüfung against the progressive scale, and any Werbungskosten beyond
the commissions already in the lots. Rates are the 2025 figures.
