"""Parse a Trading 212 transaction-export CSV into ledger Transactions.

Trading 212's export (web app → History → Export) is a flat CSV, one row per
event, with a stable English header. This parser is deliberately strict: it
refuses the whole file unless every distinctive Trading 212 column is present
(`Action`, `Time`, `ISIN`, `Ticker`, `No. of shares`, `Price / share`), so a
statement from another broker can never be half-imported by accident.

Shape notes this parser absorbs:

* `Price / share` is quoted in the instrument currency
  (`Currency (Price / share)`) while `Total` is in the account currency.
  Trades are recorded in the *instrument* currency — the ledger stores native
  amounts and converts to EUR at the trade date downstream (stocks.data.fx).
* Trading 212 charges no commission; the currency-conversion fee column is in
  the account currency and is NOT folded into `fee` (wrong currency for the
  transaction). Fees import as 0.
* Dividends: gross = shares × per-share amount in the instrument currency,
  and the withholding-tax column becomes the fee — the convention the Spanish
  double-tax credit reads (see revolut.py) — when it is reported in that same
  currency. If the per-share fields are blank the row falls back to the
  account-currency `Total` with fee 0.
* "Dividend (Return of capital)" and its "non us" twin are read the same way
  but book as a return of capital: no income, a lower cost on the position
  (see positions.build).
* Deposits, withdrawals, interest, currency conversions and result
  adjustments are skipped with a reason, never silently dropped. Stock-split
  rows keep the shared skipped-entry shape so validate.resolve_splits can
  derive the ratio.

Nothing here writes to the ledger; the Import page previews and commits.
