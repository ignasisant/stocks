"""Ask the model what an instrument's ticker is.

Broker documents identify a holding however they like: a company name ("Meta
Platforms Inc.", "LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton"), an ISIN
("US0231351067"), a venue-qualified symbol ("ZBRA:xnas"), and often several of
those in one file. The ledger wants one thing — the Yahoo Finance ticker the
rest of the app prices with — and extraction copies whatever the page said,
so something has to bridge the two.

That something is the model, not a table. Knowing that US0231351067 is Amazon,
that LVMH trades as MC.PA and that PDD's ADR is PDD is exactly what a language
model already holds and what a lookup file can only ever hold a slice of; the
slice is what made this fail on a French listing and on every ISIN. So the
labels a document actually used are collected and sent in one small call, and
the reply is a label -> ticker map.

The reply is not trusted blindly — a value that isn't ticker-shaped is
discarded, and anything the model declines to name is left exactly as the
document wrote it, so validate.py rejects that row by name and the preview
shows the user what it could not place. A wrong ticker is far worse than a
rejected row: it silently books someone else's shares into the ledger.

One call per import, distinct labels only, memoised for the process — a
statement that names the same five holdings on nine pages asks once, and a
second file naming them again asks not at all.

Reply with ONLY a JSON object, no prose, no code fences: every input label,
copied verbatim as the key, mapped to its ticker as a string, or to null.

Rules:
- Use the listing the instrument actually trades as. A US listing is bare
  ("AMZN"); anywhere else takes the Yahoo suffix ("MC.PA", "SAP.DE",
  "AZN.L", "NESN.SW"). An ADR maps to the ADR's own US symbol ("PDD").
- An ISIN maps to the ticker of the security it identifies.
- A label that is not an instrument at all — a currency code, a cash or fee
  line, an account or transaction id — maps to null.
- null is the right answer whenever you are not sure. A wrong ticker books
  the wrong company's shares; a null is shown to the user to fix by hand.

    suffix. Any other venue is knowledge, so "TEF:xmce" goes to the model.

    Nothing else is, symbol-shaped or not. A label that *looks* like a bare
    ticker is regularly not one: "AIRBUS" and "NVIDIA" are six characters of
    a name column, "TESLA" and "ADOBE" five, and no length tells them from
    "GOOGL". A dotted suffix lies the same way — XTB writes "PLTR.US" and
    "SHEL.UK", while Yahoo has no .US at all and spells that London line
    SHEL.L. Booked verbatim, each of those is a holding that prices as
    nothing, and validation cannot fault it. Which strings are tickers is
    exactly the knowledge this module delegates.

    Delegating is nearly free: the unresolved labels of an import go up in
