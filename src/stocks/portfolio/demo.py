"""Demo transactions — a hardcoded book, so an empty account can see the app.

Everything on the Portfolio page derives from the ledger, so an account that
has not imported yet finds positions, P/L, allocation, risk, dividends, fees
and the tax report all blank at once. The Import page answers that with a real
broker statement (`platforms.Platform.sample`), which is the honest path and
the one to take when the reader is ready to import. This module answers the
other half of it: a reader who has not decided yet, and wants to *look* first.

Three rules keep a fabricated book from becoming a liability in an app that
also files tax reports:

* **Every row is marked.** The note's first word is `demo`, which is exactly
  what `fees.broker_of` reads a row's origin from, so demo rows are one SQL
  `LIKE` away everywhere and show up under their own name in the Fees and
  Custody views rather than posing as a broker.
* **The first real import wipes them.** Both commit paths (the Import page and
  the assistant) call `clear()` before writing, so a real book never has
  invented lots mixed into its cost basis. They are also excluded from the
  duplicate/oversell baseline the incoming batch is validated against, since
  they are about to be gone.
* **The prices are the real ones.** Roughly the actual closes on the dates
  below — a demo whose P/L is +900% teaches nothing about the app and
  everything about the fabrication.

The book is deliberately static: seven well-known US names, bought over two
years, with adds, two sells, dividends and a custody fee, so every tab has
something in it. It is not meant to be anyone's portfolio.
