"""Parse a Revolut trading account-statement CSV into ledger Transactions.

Revolut's stock statement is a flat CSV, one row per event, so the shared
DictReader pipeline in `stocks.portfolio.statement` runs it — this module
supplies only what is Revolut-specific. Quirks it absorbs:

* Money fields carry a currency symbol and thousands separators ("$1,301.50").
* Dates are ISO timestamps ("2023-01-03T14:30:00.000Z") — we keep the date part.
* Column names and the exact `Type` strings have drifted across app versions, so
  columns are matched case-insensitively and types are mapped by keyword.

Design choices (see module tests):

* buy / sell / dividend / return-of-capital rows become Transactions. Cash top-ups, withdrawals and
  transfers are *not* position-affecting and are reported as skipped, never
  silently dropped.
* Stock splits are NOT auto-imported: Revolut reports the resulting share count,
  not the split ratio positions.py needs, and a wrong ratio corrupts every later
  lot. Split rows are surfaced in `skipped` with a note to add them by hand.
* Dividends map to price=gross total, fee=0. Revolut's statement does not break
  out withholding tax, so the Spanish double-tax credit will be understated —
  edit the fee on dividend rows if your statement reports withholding.
* A return of capital maps to action="capital", price=total, the same shape:
  positions.py takes it off the cost of the shares held that day.

Nothing here writes to the ledger. The caller previews `ParseResult.transactions`
and only then commits (see the web Import page / ledger.add_many).
