"""Work out which parser an uploaded statement needs, without asking.

The Import page has the user pick their broker first; the assistant can't —
a file arrives in chat with nothing but its name. So every registered parser
whose extensions match is simply *tried*, and the first one that yields
transactions wins.

Order is by strictness, not by registry position. Most parsers key off exact
headers (Trading 212, DEGIRO, IBKR, ClickTrade) and decline anything they
don't own, so they go first in whatever order the registry lists them. Three
resolve their columns by *alias* and are permissive enough to claim each
other's files — generic.py, Revolut stocks and Revolut crypto — so they go
last, and only after their distinctive header has been sighted. That check is
not cosmetic: without it a Revolut *stock* statement is claimed by the crypto
parser, which imports NVO as the pair NVO-USD, and a ledger-format CSV is
claimed by the stock one, which drops its fees and notes.

That is the whole reason detection can't just reuse the registry order the
Import page shows: there the user has already said which broker it is.

Whatever no parser claims falls through to llm_map: one cheap call names the
columns, and the rows are converted in Python. That fallback is the reason an
arbitrary broker Excel or a hand-kept spreadsheet can be imported at all.

Detection is read-only — the caller still validates (validate.py) and previews
before anything reaches the ledger, exactly as the Import page does.
