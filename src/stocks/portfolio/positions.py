"""Share matching: transactions -> open positions + realized sales.

Which shares a sale actually sold is a legal question, and the answer differs
by country, so `build(matching=...)` takes the rule:

* ``"fifo"`` — oldest lots first. Spain mandates it (art. 37 LIRPF), Germany
  too (§20(4) S.7 EStG), and it is the US broker default when the filer
  identifies no lots. This is the default here.
* ``"lifo"`` — newest lots first. Italy mandates it (art. 67 TUIR: the shares
  disposed of are the most recently acquired ones), which in a rising market
  books a *smaller* gain than FIFO on the same trades.
* ``"average"`` — one averaged holding per ticker, the cost recomputed on every
  purchase: Canada's adjusted cost base (ITA s.47) and France's prix moyen
  pondéré (CGI art. 150-0 D). No lot survives a purchase, so a sale's cost is
  never a specific lot's own.
* ``"s104"`` — the UK's three-step identification (TCGA 1992 s.105/106A):
  acquisitions on the *same day* first, then any made in the 30 days *after*
  the disposal, then the Section 104 pool at its average cost. Only the pool
  step averages, and that is exactly what makes a UK gain different from a
  FIFO one on the same trades.

Acquisition cost includes buy commissions; sale proceeds are net of sell
commissions. This module is pure: the currency converter is injected so it can
be unit-tested without network.

Money fields hold the *reporting* currency picked by `build(base=...)`: the
account's own currency for the app's analytics, the tax jurisdiction's for a
tax replay (see stocks.portfolio.tax). `*_native` stays in the trade currency.
