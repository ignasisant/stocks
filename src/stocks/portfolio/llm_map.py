"""Import a broker export nobody wrote a parser for, by mapping its columns.

The dedicated parsers (revolut, degiro, ibkr, …) all key off exact headers, so
an export from a broker we don't cover — or a spreadsheet the user keeps by
hand — has nowhere to go. This module fills that gap: the file is read into a
raw grid of text cells, a *sample* of it goes to the model, and what comes
back is a **mapping**, not data:

    {"header_row": 3,
     "columns": {"date": 0, "ticker": 2, "action": 4, "quantity": 5,
                 "price": 6, "amount": 9, "currency": 7, "fee": 8,
                 "note": null},
     "date_format": "%d/%m/%Y", "decimal": ",", "thousands": ".",
     "action_map": {"Compra": "buy", "Venta": "sell", "Dividendo": "dividend"}}

The mapping is then applied to every row **in Python**. That split is the
whole point: the model never transcribes a price or a date, so it cannot
hallucinate one into the ledger, and a 10-row file costs exactly as much to
map as a 2000-row one. Columns are addressed by index rather than by header
text — no fuzzy matching, and duplicate or blank headers stay unambiguous.

PDFs get the other treatment. A PDF has no regular grid to map: instrument
names wrap over two lines, the table breaks across pages, and hundreds of
cover-page and footer lines sit around it. So for PDFs the model *extracts*
the transactions themselves, a few pages per call. That is a deliberate
exception to the rule above, and the guard against a hallucinated price is the
mandatory preview: nothing an extraction produces reaches the ledger until the
user has looked at the table and pressed the button.

Either way, rows that can't be turned into a Transaction land in
``ParseResult.skipped`` with a reason, never silently dropped — the same
contract generic.py has. Semantic checks (future dates, oversells, unknown
tickers) stay in validate.py, so an LLM-read import is quarantined exactly
like a Revolut one. Nothing here writes to the ledger.

- "ticker": the symbol column. Failing that, the ISIN column, failing that
  the instrument-name column — a name is resolved to its symbol later. Never
  an id column (position id, transaction id, order reference).
- "price" is the per-share price column, "amount" the row's total cash column
  — the one that is negative for a purchase and positive for a sale or a
  dividend. Many exports carry both: map both. Never map one column to the
  other's name, and leave "amount" null when the file has no total column.
- For a split, "quantity" is the ratio.
- "action_map" needs one entry per distinct value you can see in the action
  column, including the ones you would ignore — map those to the closest of
  buy/sell/dividend/fee/split, and leave out only values that are clearly not
  transactions (cash top-ups, transfers, balance lines).
- When that column is a sentence that differs in every row ("YOU BOUGHT
  PROSHARES ULTRAPRO QQQ (TQQQ) (Cash)"), key the map on the phrase that
  names the action ("you bought"), never on the whole sentence.
- Never invent values from the sample rows; you are only naming columns.

- "positions": they only state what is held right now (a portfolio report,
  a holdings summary, a valuation) with no dated movements. Return an empty
  "transactions" list — a holding is not a transaction.
- "none": no financial records here (cover page, cost glossary, disclaimer).

Rules:
- Copy values from the page. Never infer, average or complete a number, and
  never carry one row's value into another. Omit a row you cannot read in
  full rather than guessing at it.
- "date" is when the trade happened, as YYYY-MM-DD. A row with no date is not
  a transaction — leave it out.
- "ticker": the symbol if the document shows one (keep the exchange code:
  "ZBRA:xnas"), otherwise the ISIN, otherwise the instrument's full name as
  printed. Never an account, position or transaction id — those are long
  digit strings and identify the row, not the instrument.
- "quantity" and "price" are per share, unsigned; the action carries the
  direction. For a dividend, "price" is the total amount received.
- "currency" is the instrument's currency, not the account's, when they differ.
  It is never the answer for "ticker": a dividend row names its instrument in
  one column and its currency in another, so read the instrument column.
- An empty "transactions" list is a fine answer.
