"""Registry of statement platforms the Import page can parse.

One entry per broker/source: display label, accepted upload extensions, a
one-line exporting hint for the UI, and a parse callable with the uniform
signature ``parse(filename, data) -> ParseResult``. The page stays
platform-agnostic — adding a broker means writing its parser module and
appending a Platform here; validation, preview and commit are shared.
