"""Model-directed gathering: let the model fetch what the question needs.

The turn still ends the way it always has — one streamed answer through the
provider chain in web/chat_core.py — because streaming is most of what the chat
feels like. What changes is what that answer is grounded in. Instead of the
fixed pre-flight's guess (route skills, plan a search, fetch quotes for any
ticker mentioned, every single turn), a cheap tool loop runs first and the model
decides: nothing at all for "what's my biggest position?", a search and two page
reads for "why did ASML drop today?", a quote for "is NVDA above 200 yet?".

What it collects is appended to the *outgoing copy* of the user's turn, exactly
like chat_web.augment and market.augment already do — the stored history keeps
the user's own words, the prompt cache keeps its system prefix, and the final
answer is produced by the same streaming call as before. This module adds a
step; it replaces no plumbing.

Degrading is the whole design. No tool support on this provider, a rate limit,
a model that ignores the tools, a gather that runs long — all of them return
"no evidence" and leave the caller on the fixed pre-flight it already had.
