"""The read-only tools the model may call while gathering material for an answer.

The fixed pre-flight (engine.in_parallel) guesses: it routes skills, plans one
or two searches and fetches quotes for whatever tickers the message mentions,
every turn, whether or not the question needs any of it. That guess is wrong in
both directions — it reads three web pages for "what's my biggest position?"
and reads none of the second page for a question that needed it.

These tools hand the choice to the model. Each one wraps plumbing the app
already had, so nothing here is a second implementation of anything: search and
page reading are chat_web's, quotes are market's, the book snapshot is
engine's. What is new is that they are *offered* rather than *applied*.

Everything is read-only. The app's write actions (favourite, tag, set position…)
stay on the single-shot detector in chat/tools.py, which fires once, on an
explicit request, with a confirmation bubble — an autonomous loop is the wrong
place to let a model edit the user's watchlist on a hunch.

Results are strings because that is what every provider's tool_result carries.
Each is capped: a tool that returns half a website spends the context budget
the answer needs (chat/tokens.py).
