"""The dashboard's "Daily action" — one AI briefing per account per day.

A headline plus three or four schematic lines telling the reader what to look
at today: the day's move, the name that drove it, a print due this week, a
position that drifted to a 52-week edge. It is deliberately *not* the chat: no
prompt to write, no thread to follow — the card is simply there when the page
loads, which is the whole point of putting the assistant on the dashboard.

Three properties shape everything here:

  - It changes once a day. `action_day()` turns the card over at 09:00 in the
    reader's own zone (CUTOFF_HOUR), before the European open and while the US
    premarket is quoting; until then the previous day's card stands, stamped
    with its own date so nobody mistakes it for this morning's. One LLM call
    per account per day is what makes an always-on card affordable on the free
    chain, so the stored copy (auth.load_action / save_action) is authoritative
    and a rerun never regenerates.

  - It never blocks the dashboard. Generation runs through
    engine.complete_attempts, so a dead key, a rate limit or a hung provider
    falls through to the next candidate and finally to `computed()` — the same
    facts rendered without a model. The card is always on screen; only its
    prose is optional.

  - It reads the numbers the page already computed. `build_facts()` takes the
    frames Home loaded for its own cards (enriched positions, the basket
    history, the earnings calendar, the 52-week scan), so the briefing costs no
    extra network work.

Headless by construction: paths and language come in as arguments, the module
imports no Streamlit, and stocks/web/daily_ui.py is the thin Streamlit layer
over it.

# into a new one ("about 5%") or carry one over from the example in the
# prompt. Every such figure must be traceable to `facts`, so the audit below
# is a hard gate: a card with an untraceable number is a provider miss, and
# the next candidate — or `computed()` — writes the card instead.
# One written figure. A space belongs to the number only when it separates a
# group of exactly three digits, which is the one thing it can legitimately
# be — before that rule "the S&P 500 is 8.1% under its high" read as the
# single figure 5008.1, and a perfectly sourced card was rejected over an
# index whose name ends in a number. The grouped form is tried first and
# requires a group, so a bare "1234,5" still falls through to the plain form
# whole instead of being cut after its third digit.
