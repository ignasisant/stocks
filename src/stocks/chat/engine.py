"""Headless chat engine — the web assistant's brain without the Streamlit UI.

Everything the side panel (web/chat_core.py) and the Telegram bot
(stocks/chat/bot.py) share lives here: the persona built from the investor
profile, the portfolio snapshot for the system prompt, skill routing, the
BYOK→free provider resolution (also used by notify/narrative.py), the free
-tier daily quota, and answer() — one complete chat turn against explicit
paths, no session state. chat_core wraps these helpers with st.session_state
and its cached loaders; this module never imports streamlit.

Write discipline: answer() saves chat.json only after a completed
user+assistant pair (matching the web panel), and mutates/saves prefs.json
only for the free-quota counter. A live web session writing the same files is
last-write-wins — accepted, the overlap window is a single turn.
