"""Long-term memory for the chat: past conversations, searchable by meaning.

The thread the model sees is the last MAX_CONTEXT_MSGS messages of the current
conversation (chat/engine.py). Everything before that — the other threads, last
month's reasoning about a position, the conclusion the user asked for in March
— is on disk and invisible. Asking "what did I decide about ASML?" gets an
answer built from nothing.

This is the index that makes it visible: every turn worth keeping is embedded
and stored next to the account's other files, and `recall` finds the ones that
mean the same thing as a question, not the ones sharing its words. It is
surfaced as one more tool the gather step may call (chat/toolbox.py), so the
model reaches for it when a question sounds like it has history, and ignores it
otherwise.

Two small dependencies do the work, both chosen so this survives a Cloud Run
cold start with no network and no GPU:

- **model2vec** (`potion-base-32M`, 512 dims) — static embeddings: a lookup
  table, not a transformer forward pass. CPU, milliseconds per turn, no torch.
  Baked into the image like the tiktoken table; it costs ~250MB there, which
  the smaller potion-base-8M would not — but 8M ranked an unrelated answer
  above the right one on the first question tried, and a memory that returns
  the wrong memory is worse than no memory.
- **sqlite-vec** — vector search as a SQLite extension. No server, no daemon,
  one file per account that syncs to the bucket with everything else.

Search is **hybrid**: the vectors above, fused with SQLite's own FTS5 keyword
index. Neither half is enough on its own. The static model is trained on
English and misranks Spanish — "¿qué decidí sobre ASML?" put an unrelated
Nvidia answer first in testing — while a keyword index cannot find "the
conclusion about concentration" from "how much of one thing is too much". But
tickers, company names and numbers are exactly what a user asks about later,
and those the keyword half nails in any language. Ranks are combined with
reciprocal rank fusion, which needs no score calibration between two searches
whose numbers mean different things.

Both dependencies are optional. Without them `available()` is False, the tool
is never offered, and the chat behaves exactly as it did before.
