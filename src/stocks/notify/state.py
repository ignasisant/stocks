"""Per-account alert delivery state — dedupe so hourly checks don't spam.

An alert condition ("NVDA above 190") often stays true for days; the hourly
cron must message on the rising edge, then stay quiet until either the
condition clears (re-arming the edge) or a 24h cooldown passes (one daily
re-reminder while it holds). State lives in alerts_state.json next to the
account's prefs.json and is mirrored to the bucket like every user file —
the cron is its only writer, so it never races the live app (which only
writes prefs/watchlist).
