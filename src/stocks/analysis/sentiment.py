"""Market-pulse math: the composite sentiment score, its inputs, and the
personalisation that ties a regime reading to one book's actual exposure.

Everything here is a pure function over price series, so the whole page is
testable without a network. The symbol registries below are the single source
of truth for what the page fetches — add a row and the bulk download, the
tiles and the tests all pick it up.

**Why a composite of our own.** CNN's Fear & Greed index is the obvious thing
to show, and its data endpoint answers a scripted request with
``I'm a teapot. You're a bot.`` — so it is not an option, and scraping around
that would be both fragile and rude. The composite here is built from seven
readings the app can fetch openly, and it explains itself: the page prints
each component's contribution next to the headline number, which a black-box
index could never do.

**How a component becomes a score.** Every component is a raw daily series
where "higher" consistently means one direction (VIX up = fear, HY spread up =
fear, breadth up = greed). Each is converted to 0-100 by its *rolling
percentile rank over the trailing year* — where today's reading sits against
its own last 252 sessions — and inverted where high means fear. That gives
one comparable scale for a volatility index, a credit spread and a price
ratio without hand-tuned thresholds, and because the rank is rolling the
whole thing has a real history: the composite series is the daily mean of the
component series, not a single number with a made-up past.

A percentile is a *relative* statement and must be read as one. A VIX at its
one-year low scores 100 whether that low is 11 or 25 — the composite says
"calm for this year", never "calm in absolute terms". The absolute reading
sits next to it on the page for exactly that reason.
