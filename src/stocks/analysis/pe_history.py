"""P/E relative to its own history — is today's multiple rich or cheap?

No free source publishes a clean historical P/E series, so we reconstruct it:

    P/E(t) = split-adjusted price(t) / TTM diluted EPS known at t

Price comes from yfinance (split-adjusted). TTM EPS is rebuilt from per-quarter
diluted EPS (SEC EDGAR primary; FMP fallback for non-US), summed over a trailing
four quarters and stamped at each quarter's *filing* date to avoid look-ahead
bias. As-reported EPS is split-adjusted to match the price series — without this
a split (e.g. NVDA 10:1) destroys the historical window.

Pure functions (split_factors / discrete_quarters / reconstruct_ttm_eps /
pe_series / window_stats) take their inputs explicitly and run offline; only
pe_vs_history touches the network.
